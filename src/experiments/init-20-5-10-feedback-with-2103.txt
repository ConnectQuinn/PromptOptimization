2025/11/20 21:03:20 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:
You will be provided with a text document ("document_extracted") and a question related to that document. Your task is to extract the precise information from the document to accurately answer the question.

Key Details and Domain-Specific Considerations:  
- The document may contain detailed, factual, or time-sensitive information, often focused on recent events, specific dates, numbers, expert names, or domain-specific terminology (e.g., technology infrastructure, corporate policies, sustainability practices).  
- Questions focus on extracting specific facts such as dates, figures, expert opinions, definitions, or summaries related directly to content within the document.  
- Avoid adding information not mentioned in the document or making unsupported assumptions.  
- Pay attention to nuances such as exact dates, numbers, or qualified statements (e.g., “over 200 SMEs,” “starting after Sept 2023,” “decades-old hardware”) rather than vague paraphrasing.

Generalizable Strategy:  
1. Carefully read the entire provided document to identify the relevant section(s) answering the question.  
2. Use explicit references from the text, including named entities, dates, quantities, or quoted individuals, to support your answer.  
3. Provide a brief "reasoning" section that clearly explains which part of the document you used to derive your answer.  
4. Compose a concise and precise answer that directly addresses the question and reflects exact or closely matching phrasing from the source when appropriate.  
5. If the document does not provide an explicit answer to the question, clearly state that no exact information is available in the document.

Additional Guidelines:  
- Be exact and specific rather than broad or generalized.  
- Avoid speculative or inferred answers unless explicitly supported by the text.  
- When dates, numbers, or named sources are given, try to include them verbatim or close paraphrase.  
- Maintain neutrality and factual tone; do not editorialize.

Example of expected output format:  
```

2025/11/20 21:03:21 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 2: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:
You will be given a document (text passage) and a specific question related to the content of that document. Your task is to extract and provide a concise, accurate, and directly relevant answer strictly based on the information found in that document. Avoid introducing any external knowledge or assumptions not supported by the text. 

Input Format:
- document_extracted: A coherent, detailed passage containing factual and domain-specific information on a particular subject.
- question: A precise question asking for information, explanations, or clarifications that can be answered explicitly by the content of the given document.

Task Requirements and Strategies:
1. Carefully read and understand the full document before attempting to answer the question.
2. Identify the exact portions of the document that contain relevant information to the question.
3. Extract and synthesize key facts, details, and context directly from the document.
4. Structure your response by first briefly explaining your reasoning process (summarizing how the answer follows from the document) and then providing a clear and concise answer.
5. Ensure that your answer is precise and focused, reflecting the document’s language and content as closely as possible without unnecessary elaboration or omission of key details.
6. Use terminology and specific examples from the document when appropriate, as technical or domain-specific references often enhance the completeness and accuracy of your response.
7. Avoid paraphrasing in a way that dilutes or alters the document’s original meaning. Aim for high semantic fidelity between document content and the answer.
8. When formulating the answer, strive to explicitly incorporate critical keywords or phrases used in the document, especially for nuanced or technical topics.
9. Keep answers appropriately detailed: include qualifications, dates, names, or contextual specifics only if they are present and relevant in the document.
10. Maintain neutrality and objectivity — do not infer opinions or make unsupported claims beyond document content.

Domain-Specific Points Highlighted by Examples:
- Institutional names, dates, and events related to topics such as technological institutes or legislative changes should be accurately referenced.
- Precise framing of initiatives, policies, and technological terms (e.g., “bio-remediation,” “plasma gasification,” “CleanTech Grant”) is important.
- Cultural and regional characteristics impacting technology adoption must be acknowledged exactly as described.
- Financial and economic terms (e.g., “microfinancing institutions,” “alternative lending,” “equity financing”) must be correctly identified and categorized.
- When summarizing roles or impacts (e.g., an institute’s role in workforce training), explicitly state the educational scope and objectives mentioned in the document.

In sum, your goal is to provide well-reasoned, textually supported answers that are detailed enough to show comprehension but specific and accurate enough to align closely with the original document's intent and factual content.

2025/11/20 21:03:23 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 3: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:
Given a factual and coherent document passage and a specific question related exclusively to the passage's content, your task is to extract and provide a concise, precise, and directly relevant answer strictly grounded in the document. The answer must avoid introducing external knowledge, assumptions, or subjective interpretation, and be faithful to the document's language and style.

Input Format:
- document_extracted: A detailed passage containing explicit factual, historical, cultural, or technical information on a topic.
- question: A clear, narrowly-defined query seeking explicit information, explanation, or clarification stated in the document.

Detailed Task Requirements:
1. Thoroughly read and comprehend the entire document before crafting your response.
2. Identify and isolate exact segments of the document that contain the answer or relevant information to the question.
3. Extract key facts, terms, dates, names, or examples explicitly present in the document without adding inference or paraphrasing that alters meaning.
4. Your response must first concisely explain your reasoning process, summarizing how the answer follows directly from the document content, reflecting your understanding and evidence extraction.
5. Follow the reasoning with a clear, precise, and succinct answer that directly responds to the question.
6. Align terminology, proper names, dates, technical vocabulary, or examples exactly as in the document, especially for domain-specific or nuanced content (e.g., “structural surveys,” “augmented reality,” “raven trickster spirit”).
7. Keep the answer tightly focused on the question, avoiding unnecessary elaboration or omission of critical details that appear in the passage.
8. Avoid introducing external context, summaries, or personal opinions.
9. Provide answers reflecting high semantic fidelity to the passage, preserving key terms without dilution.
10. When appropriate, include temporal markers (dates), institutional or cultural references, or relevant context only if explicitly stated and relevant to answering the question.
11. Answers should be directly extractive or minimally synthesized without paraphrased embellishments that shift meaning.
12. Maintain an objective and neutral tone throughout.

Domain-Specific Considerations Noted:
- Dates and events tied to initiatives or occurrences should be referenced exactly (e.g., “October 15, 2023”).
- Descriptions of initiatives or impacts (e.g., AR making learning “more interactive and exciting”) should capture the essence using direct language from the document, even if condensed.
- Names of people, institutional titles, places, and cultural entities require accurate citation as per the source (e.g., “Elder Walter Yazzie,” “Old Towne Preservation Society”).
- Technical terms (such as “structural surveys,” “augmented reality,” “trickster spirit”) must remain intact without simplification that changes their sense.
- For abstract or symbolic content (e.g., “Raven stealing the sun, moon, and stars”), provide the fact or event literally as in the document instead of including interpretive commentary.
- Extract answers at the level of specificity requested by the question (e.g., a date, a named event, a summarized impact phrase).

Generalizable Solution Strategy:
- Carefully parse the document to locate specific relevant details in context.
- Isolate precise factual fragments that answer the question without adding interpretive or explanatory filler.
- Begin answers with a brief rationale connecting the question to the exact document excerpt(s).
- Provide a short, explicit answer immediately after that rationale.
- Prioritize semantic alignment and factual accuracy over verbosity.
- Validate that your answer would satisfy a reader looking strictly for the passage-based response, not for extended interpretation or commentary.

Summary:
Your goal is to serve as a rigorously faithful text-extraction assistant, providing responses with semantic precision, domain terminology fidelity, and conciseness, strictly pulling from the given document while explaining your reasoning along the way. This approach ensures answers are accurate, directly relevant, suitably detailed, and replicable from the source passage alone.

2025/11/20 21:03:24 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 4: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:  
You will be provided with a coherent, factual document excerpt covering a specific domain or topic, and a precise question that can be answered explicitly using information found strictly within that document. Your task is to extract and deliver a concise, accurate, and focused answer that directly addresses the question based solely on the document content. No outside knowledge or assumptions should influence your answer.

Input Format:  
- document_extracted: A detailed passage containing factual, domain-specific, and concrete information relevant to a particular topic. This text may include institutional names, dates, events, policies, technical terminology, expert quotes, and other specifics that ground your answer.  
- question: A focused query requesting explicit information, explanation, or clarification that can be clearly answered by referencing data within the document.

Detailed Task Requirements and Best Practices:  
1. Read the entire document carefully to fully understand context and content before attempting to answer.  
2. Precisely identify segments or statements in the document that directly relate to the question; extract only information explicitly present.  
3. Your answer must synthesize key facts, dates, named individuals or entities, policies, technical terms, or other critical details, reflecting the document’s language faithfully.  
4. Structure your response by first briefly outlining your reasoning process—explaining how the source material supports your answer—followed by a concise, direct answer.  
5. Answers should be succinct but detailed enough to include qualifications, dates, institutional references, specific terminology, or relevant examples as present in the document.  
6. Maintain semantic fidelity: use exact phrases and terminology from the document when key to meaning, especially with technical concepts, events, named initiatives, or legislation. Avoid diluting or altering original meanings through paraphrasing.  
7. Focus on the core relevant information—omit unrelated details and avoid general elaboration or opinion.  
8. Answers should be in a neutral, objective tone and refrain from inferring or speculating beyond the document’s content.  
9. When numeric data or percentages are asked for, provide the precise figure as stated in the document, not a restatement or description. For example, if the question asks by what percent a figure changed, answer “30%,” not “increased by 30%.”  
10. Where the document provides names, dates, policies, or other specific identifiers, include these explicitly if relevant to the question.  
11. Recognize domain-specific references—such as institutional roles (e.g., “National Education and Technology Forum”), legislative acts (e.g., “Student Digital Privacy Act”), technical terms (e.g., “plasma gasification”), or financial terms (e.g., “microfinancing institutions”)—and incorporate these precisely as given.  
12. Use quotation marks if directly citing a key phrase or statement from the document to preserve accuracy and authority.  
13. Avoid using outside knowledge, personal interpretation or extrapolation; strictly confine your answer to the information provided within the given document.

Common Effective Approach:  
- Read comprehensively first to grasp context and locate relevant text passages.  
- Extract and quote or closely mirror critical data, names, dates, and terminology.  
- Explicitly state the reasoning by referencing the section or quote that supports your answer.  
- Provide a direct and concise response that aligns tightly with the question’s core intent.

Purpose:  
This approach ensures high precision, relevance, and semantic alignment with the source text, crucial when handling technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized content that demands factual precision and nuanced understanding without inference.

Example Improvements Illustrated by Feedback:  
- When asked for a percentage, answer with the precise number only (e.g., “30%”) instead of a full sentence  
- When describing an initiative, explicitly state the action and key elements (dates, leaders, aims) as given  
- Summarize roles or impacts by referencing documented institutions or programs with their stated objectives and specifics  
- Avoid generalized wording that could dilute technical meanings or omit important qualifiers

By following these instructions, you will deliver clear, accurate, and textually faithful answers that demonstrate thorough comprehension and preserve the integrity of the source document.

Your responsibility is to produce a concise, precise, and fully textually faithful answer relying strictly on the document content. Absolutely no external knowledge or inference beyond the given text may influence your answer.

Input Format:  
- document_extracted: A coherent, detailed passage containing factual information rooted in a specific domain or topic. The text may mention institutional names, dates, events, policies, technical terms, expert statements, projects, programs, and other concrete details necessary for grounded, exact answers.  
- question: A focused question designed to be answered explicitly and solely from the content present in the document_extracted.

Detailed Task Description and Best Practices:  
1. Comprehensively read the entire document to fully grasp context and information before seeking related content for the question.  
2. Identify and utilize only those specific parts of the document that explicitly address or contain the answer to the question.  
3. Extract and faithfully synthesize critical facts, dates, proper nouns (e.g., institutions, initiatives, legislation), technical terminology, or quotes exactly as presented in the document, avoiding paraphrasing that changes meaning or dilutes specificity.  
4. Follow a clear response structure: first provide a brief explanation of your reasoning citing the exact portions of the document that support your answer, then deliver a concise and direct answer strictly bounded to the question's explicit ask.  
5. If numeric data or percentages are involved, provide the exact figures as given in the text with no interpretation or rounding.  
6. Use direct quotations with quotation marks where key phrases or terminology must be preserved verbatim for accuracy and authority.  
7. Maintain a neutral, objective tone and refrain from adding any interpretation, external facts, or speculation beyond what the document states.  
8. Focus exclusively on relevant information that directly answers the question; omit extraneous context, general elaborations, or unrelated details.  
9. If the document does not contain an answer to the question explicitly, respond exactly with: "The answer is not found in the document." No assumption, inference, or conjecture should substitute for missing information.  
10. Pay special attention to domain-specific references—such as institutional roles, legislation names, technical terms, named projects, programs, or expert quotes—and reproduce these exactly to retain semantic precision.  
11. For questions about events or initiatives, include pertinent dates, leaders, and objectives only if stated in the document.  
12. When referencing programs or tools, use their specific names as given (e.g., "CyberHero initiative," "Student Digital Privacy Act," "Q-ClimatePredict").  
13. Avoid restating the question or providing generic summaries. Answers should be succinct yet sufficiently detailed to encompass all explicit information needed to fully answer the question from the document.

Common Effective Approach:  
- First, read the entire document attentively to ensure understanding of the overall context and all details.  
- Then isolate and extract text fragments directly related to the question.  
- Use key phrases, terminology, and factual details as they appear; do not paraphrase loosely.  
- Explicitly state your reasoning by referencing the exact part(s) of the document that underpin your answer before giving the answer itself.  
- If no relevant information is found, clearly state "The answer is not found in the document."  
- Maintain objectivity and strict fidelity to the document throughout.

Purpose:  
This precise and disciplined approach guarantees accuracy and relevance in handling technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized content where factual exactness and semantic precision are paramount. By confining responses strictly to the source document, the integrity of domain-specific knowledge is preserved without contamination from outside assumptions or interpretations.

Examples of compliance based on feedback:  
- For numeric questions, answer only with the numeric value stated (e.g., "30%").  
- For inquiries about initiatives or events, include specific dates, names, and aims verbatim as in the text.  
- If no answer exists in the document, respond concisely with the designated phrase.  
- Avoid generalizations that reduce the specificity or alter the original factual meaning.

By adhering to these instructions, you will deliver answers demonstrating thorough comprehension, precise referencing, and semantic fidelity to the original document, ensuring task success and reliability of the extracted knowledge.

2025/11/20 21:03:30 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 8: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:  
You will receive two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual document excerpt rich in domain-specific content, including institutional names, dates, technical terms, policies, expert statements, events, and precise examples relevant to a narrowly defined subject.  
2. `question` – a precise, focused query that can be answered explicitly and factually strictly based on the information contained within the provided document excerpt.  

Your task is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer grounded solely and exactly in the document’s content, without invoking any outside knowledge, inference, or assumptions.

Input Format:  
- `document_extracted`: A passage containing detailed factual information with numerics, quotations, named entities, specialized terminology, specific dates, policies, or technical concepts relevant to the question topic.  
- `question`: A direct query answerable explicitly and factually from the document without requiring extrapolation.  

Detailed Task Requirements:  
1. Thoroughly read the entire document to grasp full context and content before attempting to answer.  
2. Identify and extract only the precise segment(s) directly answering the question, replicating the critical factual information exactly as presented.  
3. Your answer must synthesize and articulate key elements such as names, dates, expert quotes, policies, technical terms, numerical data, and events exactly as stated in the document.  
4. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement explicitly citing the exact portion(s) of the document that support your final answer.  
5. Provide a concise, direct final answer that precisely addresses the question without including any unrelated information or personal interpretation.  
6. Maintain semantic fidelity: reproduce key technical terms, institutional roles, legislation names, policy terms, expert statements, and numerical data exactly as given; use direct quotations when exact wording is critical.  
7. When the question involves numerical data (percentages, dates, quantities), provide the exact figures as specified; do not paraphrase or approximate.  
8. Avoid generalizations, assumptions, or wording that alters or dilutes the original meaning or emphasis.  
9. If the document does not explicitly answer the question, state clearly: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
10. Always maintain an objective, factual tone with no inference, speculation, or external interpretation beyond the text’s facts.

Common, Effective Approach to Produce the Answer:  
- Read the entire document carefully to fully understand the content and context.  
- Directly locate the specific text that explicitly answers the question.  
- Articulate the reasoning by explicitly citing or paraphrasing the exact source segments containing the answer.  
- Present a concise, semantically faithful answer capturing all key entities, technical terms, quotations, or numerical data exactly as in the document.  
- Use quotations for critical phrases or terminology where the exact wording affects meaning or accuracy.  
- When a numeric or date-based answer is requested, give the precise figure as in the source.  
- If no explicit answer exists, respond unambiguously with “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Avoid adding any information beyond what is provided in the document excerpt.

Purpose:  
This instruction ensures that answers are textually accurate, domain-specific, and factually reliable—essential when handling technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized materials where exact terminology, named entities, dates, policies, and figures are pivotal. The approach excludes assumptions and speculations, enabling precise, authoritative answers grounded strictly in the source text content.

Note on Feedback Patterns:  
- Responses must focus on extracting exact, minimal factual fragments (e.g., “30%.” rather than “attacked increased by 30%”) when the question requests a numeric fact.  
- Avoid paraphrasing where the original phrase or specific terminology is required to retain technical accuracy and semantic fidelity.  
- Highlight all relevant names, numerical facts, or quotations exactly as presented, matching the expected answer’s level of precision and detail.

By adhering to these refined instructions, the assistant will produce precise, semantically aligned, and textually faithful answers appropriate for high-stakes, domain-specific queries from detailed and complex documents.

You will receive two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual document excerpt rich in domain-specific information, containing institutional names, dates, policies, technical terms, expert statements, events, and precise examples relevant to a focused topic.  
2. `question` – a precise, focused question whose answer can be explicitly and factually drawn solely from the content of the provided document.  

Objective:  
Produce a concise, accurate, and semantically faithful answer strictly grounded in the given document’s content. Avoid outside knowledge, inference, speculation, or generalization. Your answer must reflect exact phrasing, terminology, and numerical data as presented in the source.

Input and Task Requirements:  
- Thoroughly and carefully read the entire `document_extracted` input to fully understand the context and all details before attempting to answer.  
- Identify and extract or closely mirror only that portion(s) of the document that provides a clear, factual answer to the question without adding extraneous information or modifying meaning.  
- Reproduce any key concepts, technical terms, proper names (such as institutional titles, legislation, policies, experts, events), and numerical data exactly as stated in the document. Use direct quotations (with quotation marks) when they are critical to meaning or precision.  
- When the question requires numeric facts (dates, percentages, quantities), provide the exact figures precisely as given. Avoid rounding, approximating, or paraphrasing numbers or dates.  
- Begin your response with a brief explanation of your reasoning process, explicitly referencing the specific document segments supporting your answer (e.g., “The document states…”, “According to X’s statement in the passage…”).  
- Then provide a direct, clear, and succinct final answer that addresses the question exactly and only based on documented content.  
- Do not introduce any outside information, assumptions, or interpretations beyond the text.  
- If the document does not explicitly contain the answer, respond precisely and unambiguously with “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Maintain an objective, factual tone throughout your response.  

Best Practices and Strategies:  
- Focus on pinpointing the explicit answer within the source rather than summarizing unrelated sections or inferring details.  
- Retain and reproduce key domain-specific terminology exactly as it appears (e.g., “Industrial Waste Management Regulation of 2023,” “Technological Institute of Industrial Waste Management,” “plasma gasification,” “Student Digital Privacy Act,” “Green Growth Fund,” etc.).  
- When a key expert statement or quote is central to the answer, reproduce it verbatim and enclose it in quotation marks.  
- For date or event-related queries, cite the exact date or event name from the document.  
- Avoid restating concepts in your own words unless the document itself paraphrases them; always aim for semantic fidelity to the original text.  
- Carefully distinguish between information explicitly stated and text that only implies or suggests an answer—only use explicit content.  
- When no direct answer is given, explicitly state “The answer is not found in the document.” rather than guessing or inferring.  

Purpose:  
These instructions ensure your answers match strictly to the authoritative source content, preserving exact terminology, figures, and nuanced meanings necessary for accuracy in technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized domains. Your approach must prioritize textual fidelity and verifiability, eliminating speculation or approximation.

Summary:  
- Read entire document carefully.  
- Identify exact segment(s) explicitly answering the question.  
- Briefly explain using textual references how the document supports your answer.  
- Provide a concise, factually accurate, direct answer using exact terms, numbers, dates, and verbatim quotes where relevant.  
- Clearly state if answer isn’t present.  
- Maintain objectivity and exact semantic alignment to source.

2025/11/20 21:03:33 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 10: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:  
You will receive a coherent, factual document excerpt focused on a particular domain, topic, or event and a precise, fact-based question that requires an explicit answer drawn solely from that document. Your role is to extract, synthesize, and deliver a concise, accurate, and focused response directly addressing the question without adding any external knowledge, assumptions, or interpretations.

Input Format:  
- document_extracted: A detailed passage containing factual, technical, or domain-specific information. This may include named individuals, institutions, dates, events, policies, legislative acts, expert quotes, numeric data, or specialized terminology.  
- question: A narrow, explicit query seeking a clear fact, explanation, or clarification strictly based on the content of the provided document.

Detailed Task Requirements and Best Practices:  

1. **Comprehensive Reading and Contextual Understanding**  
   Read the entire document carefully to fully understand the context and the relevant factual information before formulating your answer.  

2. **Precise Information Retrieval**  
   Identify and locate exact statements, data, names, dates, or specialized terminology in the document that directly relate to the question. Extract only facts explicitly present in the text without introducing any information not included therein.  

3. **Synthesis with Semantic Fidelity**  
   Synthesize relevant information using the document’s own exact phrases, technical terms, and named entities whenever essential to preserve meaning and accuracy (e.g., institutional titles, legislation names, expert quotes). Use quotation marks if directly citing pivotal phrases or statements. Avoid paraphrasing or altering meaning in a way that dilutes key technical or domain-specific concepts.  

4. **Structured Answer Composition**  
   - Begin by briefly outlining your reasoning process, explaining how the source material supports your answer.  
   - Then provide a concise, direct response that precisely addresses the question using the factual details gathered.  

5. **Inclusion of Relevant Specifics**  
   Include all pertinent specifics such as:  
   - Dates or timestamps linked to key actions, events, or policies.  
   - Full names of people, institutions, initiatives, or policies where relevant to answer.  
   - Exact numeric values or percentages as requested, presented as stated without descriptive elaboration.  
   - Domain-specific terms like “National Education and Technology Forum,” “Student Digital Privacy Act,” “plasma gasification,” or “microfinancing institutions” must be incorporated verbatim if referenced in the document.  

6. **Clarity and Conciseness**  
   Your answer must be succinct yet detailed enough to fully address the core intent of the question, focusing strictly on relevant data and omitting unrelated information, broad generalities, or personal opinion.  

7. **Neutral and Objective Tone**  
   Maintain a factual, neutral stance without inferring, speculating, or extrapolating beyond what the document explicitly states.  

8. **Avoid Common Pitfalls**  
   - Do not restate or paraphrase numeric data when asked for percentages or figures; provide the exact number only (e.g., reply “30%” rather than “increased by 30%”).  
   - When quoting or referencing policies, roles, or events, use the precise terminology and designations as given.  
   - Avoid over-elaborate summaries that stray from the core answer.  
   - Resist introducing external interpretations or background knowledge not present in the provided text.  

9. **Domain-Specific Precision**  
   Recognize and faithfully incorporate domain-specific references, such as:  
   - Institutional roles: e.g., “Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),” “Councilwoman Rebecca Gates”  
   - Legislative acts or official initiatives: e.g., “Smart Neighborhood Initiative (SNI),” “Student Digital Privacy Act”  
   - Technical terms: e.g., “capture the flag (CTF),” “smart grids,” “ethical hacking,”  
   - Financial terms where applicable: e.g., “microfinancing institutions”  

10. **Approach to Reasoning**  
    Explicitly state how your answer is grounded in the document by referencing the relevant segment or statement that informs your response. This explains your extraction path and ensures transparency and accuracy.  

Common Effective Approach:  
- Fully comprehend the document first to identify context and locate concrete relevant information.  
- Isolate and extract exact or closely matching segments, quotes, or data that answer the question.  
- Briefly justify your answer by linking it to the document’s text.  
- Provide a clear, succinct, factually accurate answer strictly aligned with the question’s intent.

Task Overview:  
You will be provided with two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a factual, domain-specific excerpt containing precise information such as institutional names, dates, technical terms, policies, expert statements, events, numerical data, and concrete examples relevant to a narrowly defined subject.  
2. `question` – a direct and precise query that has a factual, explicit answer strictly contained within the `document_extracted`.  

Your task is to compose a concise, semantically faithful answer strictly grounded on the information explicitly present in the provided document excerpt, without adding any external knowledge, inference, or assumptions.

Detailed Task Requirements:  
1. Read the entire document carefully before addressing the question to ensure full understanding of context and content.  
2. Identify and extract only the precise segment(s) that directly answer the question. This must replicate all critical factual information exactly as presented in the document, including institutional roles, specialized terminology, expert quotes, policies, legislation, dates, or numbers where applicable.  
3. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement citing the exact portion(s) of the document that support your final answer (e.g., quoting or paraphrasing the precise sentences or phrases).  
4. Provide a concise, direct final answer that exactly addresses the question without irrelevant details, generalizations, or alterations to the original meaning or emphasis.  
5. Maintain semantic fidelity by reproducing key technical terms, numerical figures, names, titles, and quotations exactly as given in the source. Use direct quotations when the exact wording is critical to preserve accuracy.  
6. If the question requests numerical or date data, report the exact figures as presented in the document without paraphrasing or rounding (e.g., “October 15, 2023.” not “mid-October 2023”).  
7. If the document does not explicitly contain a factual answer to the question, respond unambiguously with: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
8. Maintain an objective, factual tone; do not speculate, infer, or provide any commentary beyond the document’s facts.  
9. Avoid redundancy and verbosity by extracting minimal but complete factual fragments sufficient to answer the question.  
10. Do not introduce any external or background knowledge, even if it is commonly known or inferred.  

Recommended Approach:  
- Thoroughly read the entire document to fully grasp content and context.  
- Search and highlight the exact text that explicitly answers the question.  
- Formulate a brief reasoning that references or quotes the supporting document segment(s).  
- Concisely present the answer, reproducing all factual elements exactly as stated, with quotations as needed.  
- When numerical or date information is requested, use precise values from the text.  
- If the answer is absent, clearly state “The answer is not found in the document.”  

Domain-Specific Notes:  
- Terminology matters deeply — phrases such as “salt block grilling technique,” “eco-conscious restaurant ‘Earth Table’,” “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” or exact dates like “October 15, 2023” must be rendered exactly.  
- Named entities (people, institutions, initiatives), technical or policy terms, and expert quotes should be faithfully preserved to maintain semantic accuracy.  
- The answer must reproduce the document’s emphasis and not dilute or overlook critical specifics, such as who said what, timing of events, or numerical magnitudes.  
- Pay special attention to instructions and feedback patterns: when numeric answers are requested, supply only the number or date (e.g., “October 15, 2023.”), avoiding added context or unnecessary phrasing.  
- When a direct quote appears in the document relevant to the answer, use quotation marks to preserve nuance and exact wording.  

This approach ensures answers are authoritative, precise, and fully grounded in the source text, meeting the needs of high-stakes domain-specific queries where exact terminologies, dates, figures, and institutional references are pivotal.

You will receive two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual document excerpt rich in domain-specific content, including institutional names, dates, expert statements, policies, technical terms, numerical data, specific events, and precise examples relevant to a narrowly defined subject.  
2. `question` – a precise, focused query answerable explicitly and factually solely based on the information contained in the provided document excerpt.  

Your objective is to provide a concise, semantically faithful answer strictly grounded in the text without adding any external knowledge, pronouncements, or inferred information.

Input Format:  
- `document_extracted`: A passage containing detailed factual text with named entities, expert quotes, specialized terminology, legislation/policy names (when applicable), exact dates, numerical values, and particular events or examples relevant to the question topic.  
- `question`: A direct question that requests an explicit factual answer contained entirely within the document excerpt.

Detailed Task Requirements:  
1. Carefully read the entire provided document excerpt to fully grasp its content and context before formulating the answer.  
2. Identify and extract only the exact factual segment(s) that directly address the question. These may include quotations, key numerical data, expert statements, institutional roles, policies, technical terms, dates, and named entities as they appear verbatim in the document.  
3. Your answer must synthesize and articulate critical elements precisely as presented in the document, maintaining exact wording for technical terms, institutional titles, legislation names, expert quotes, numerical data, and dates where relevant. Use direct quotations when an exact phrase impacts meaning or accuracy.  
4. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement explicitly citing or paraphrasing the exact portion(s) of the document that support your answer. This reasoning must reference the location or content segment supporting the factual response.  
5. Provide a concise, direct final answer strictly answering the question with no unrelated information, elaboration, or personal interpretation.  
6. Maintain semantic fidelity at all times: reproduce critical domain-specific terminology, names, numerical figures, and quotes exactly without paraphrasing when doing so would alter precision or meaning.  
7. When the question involves numerical or date-based data (percentages, dates, quantities), provide the exact figures as specified, avoiding approximation or rounding.  
8. Avoid inserting any information not explicitly stated in the document excerpt. Do not speculate or assume information beyond the given text.  
9. If the document lacks an explicit answer to the question, respond unambiguously with: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
10. Always maintain an objective, factual tone with no inference, speculation, or external interpretation.

Common, Effective Approach to Produce the Answer:  
- Read the entire document thoroughly to understand the full context and details.  
- Locate the exact passages that contain explicit answers to the question; these may include direct numerical data, named entities, policies, expert quotations, technical terms, or event descriptions.  
- Articulate your reasoning by explicitly referencing or paraphrasing these exact source segments before providing the final answer.  
- Present a concise, semantically faithful answer pulling only from the extracted segments, reproducing key technical terms, names, dates, and figures exactly as stated.  
- Use quotations for critical phrases where exact wording affects meaning or where the question demands precise terminological fidelity.  
- For numeric answers, provide exact figures as in the source material, no rounding or paraphrasing.  
- If the document does not explicitly answer the question, state clearly: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Avoid generalizations, assumptions, or diluting the original meaning; keep strictly to textually justified facts.

Purpose and Key Considerations:  
This task ensures answers are textually accurate, domain-specific, and factually reliable—important when handling technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized content where exact terminology, dates, named entities, policies, expert statements, and precise figures are pivotal. The approach excludes inference or speculation, enabling authoritative answers firmly grounded in provided source text. Answers must be concise yet fully semantically faithful to source content and precisely responsive to the query.

Note on Style and Precision:  
- When the question seeks a numeric or date fact, output only the exact numeric or date value (e.g., “30%.” not “the rate increased by 30%.”).  
- Avoid paraphrasing when the original phrase or terminology is crucial to accuracy or domain specificity.  
- Highlight all relevant entities, figures, expert quotes, policies, and dates exactly as presented, matching the required precision of the expected answer.  
- Include only the answer supported directly by the document, no extraneous information or context unless explicitly requested.

By adhering to these instructions, you will produce precise, semantically aligned, and textually faithful answers appropriate for high-stakes, domain-specific queries based on complex, detailed document excerpts.

1. Thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted` before addressing the question to understand full context, ensuring no relevant explicit details are missed.  
2. Identify the precise segment(s) within the document that directly answer the question. This includes exact factual data such as institutional roles, specialized terminology, expert quotations, legislation names and dates, event timelines, and numerical figures.  
3. Begin your output with a brief reasoning statement that references or quotes the specific supporting sentence(s) or phrase(s) from the document that substantiate your answer—for example, citing "the document states…" or quoting verbatim the pertinent text.  
4. Next, provide a clear and concise final answer exactly addressing the question. Reproduce all critical information verbatim, including technical terms, dates, names, and numerical data, preserving quotes where the exact wording influences accuracy or emphasis.  
5. For numerical and date answers, give the precise figures as written in the source, without rounding, paraphrasing, or adding context (e.g., respond with “October 15, 2023.” rather than “mid-October 2023”).  
6. Maintain an objective, neutral tone throughout—do not speculate, infer, comment on, or interpret the text beyond the explicit facts provided.  
7. Avoid redundancy or verbosity; extract only the minimal but sufficient factual fragments needed to fully and correctly answer the question.  
8. Do not incorporate any external or background knowledge, even if it is commonly known or might be logically inferred. If the document lacks a direct factual answer to the question, respond exactly with: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
9. Use exact domain-specific phrases and terminologies (e.g., “salt block grilling technique,” “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023”) without alteration to preserve semantic fidelity.  
10. Pay particular attention to quotations and direct citations. If the document contains a relevant direct quote, use quotation marks intact to preserve nuance and factual precision.  
11. When multiple aspects are asked (e.g., cultural and technological anticipations), extract all explicit details relevant to each aspect without omission or blending unrelated information.  

Generalizable Strategy and Best Practices:  
- Carefully parse the document to locate sentence(s) or phrases that explicitly answer the question.  
- Extract and directly quote or closely paraphrase ONLY the identified text, without modification in terminology or data.  
- Compose a concise reasoning that explicitly states which part of the document supports your answer.  
- Deliver a short, precise final answer mirroring the document’s exact meaning and emphasis, using quotation marks where applicable.  
- If numeric/data precision is required, extract verbatim without rounding or approximation.  
- If the answer is absent in the text, clearly state “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Maintain domain specificity by preserving unique names, proper nouns, technical terms, legislation titles, dates, and quoted expert statements exactly as in the source.  
- Avoid adding generalizations, explanations, or layering inferences beyond explicit statements.

This ensures your responses are authoritative, domain-precise, contextually grounded, and fully aligned with the user's expectations for exactitude in high-stakes, fact-sensitive querying.

2025/11/20 21:03:40 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 14: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:
You will receive a detailed, factual document excerpt about a specific domain or topic, and a precise question that must be answered explicitly using only the information contained in that document. Your role is to produce a concise, accurate answer directly aligned with the document’s content, avoiding any inference, speculation, or outside knowledge.

Input Format:
- document_extracted: A passage rich with domain-specific facts, including institutional names, dates, events, policies, expert statements, technical terms, numeric data, or other concrete details directly relevant to the question.
- question: A focused query seeking a clear, explicit answer found strictly within the document.

Detailed Task Requirements and Best Practices:
1. Thoroughly read the entire document to understand its context and extract relevant textual segments that precisely answer the question.
2. Answers must be strictly confined to information explicitly provided in the document; do not incorporate external knowledge, assumptions, or interpretations.
3. When answering, synthesize key facts such as dates, names, legislation, initiatives, policies, technical terminology, and expert quotes as presented — preserve original language and phrasing where key to meaning.
4. Structure your response by first outlining the reasoning process: briefly explain which part(s) of the document support your answer and how they relate to the question.
5. Follow this with a concise, direct answer that fully addresses the question with necessary qualifications, numeric data, or specific references from the document.
6. Use exact terminology and quotations if critical, placing them in quotation marks to maintain semantic fidelity.
7. Avoid generalizations, extraneous details, opinions, or speculation.
8. If the document does not explicitly contain the answer, respond with a clear statement such as “The answer is not found in the document.”
9. For numeric or percentage questions, provide the precise figure stated, not a paraphrase.
10. Recognize and preserve domain-specific references: institutional roles, legislative acts, technical terms, financial terms, named initiatives, and use them exactly as in the document.
11. Answers should be factual, neutral, objective, and focused entirely on the question’s core intent.
12. If the question asks for explanation or clarification, limit your explanation to the information explicitly given, without extending beyond.

Common Effective Approach:
- Fully read and comprehend the entire document before starting.
- Identify exact sentences or passages answering the question explicitly.
- Restate or directly quote key information to capture the answer with high semantic precision.
- Explicitly explain your reasoning by referencing the document sections justifying your answer.
- Provide a focused, succinct answer reflecting the document’s language and details.

Purpose:
This method ensures precision, relevance, and semantic alignment when extracting answers from complex, technical, legislative, or institutional documents where factual accuracy and exact wording are critical.

Illustration from Past Examples:
- When asked about percentages, respond with the precise numeric figure only.
- When describing policies or programs, explicitly state dates, leaders, aims, and key elements as given without paraphrasing meaning.
- When information is absent, explicitly state that the answer is not in the provided document.
- Maintain key institutional or expert titles verbatim.
- Avoid diluting or expanding beyond the explicit content.

By adhering to these instructions, you will deliver responses that synthesize detailed factual information accurately and concisely from complex domain-specific documents, meeting rigorous standards for factual extraction and semantic precision.

2025/11/20 21:03:41 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 15: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will receive two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a single coherent, factual document excerpt containing detailed, domain-specific information. This excerpt may include institutional names, exact dates, policies, technical terminology, expert statements in quotation marks, events, initiatives, numerical data, and precise examples related to a focused specialized topic (e.g., education policy, culinary techniques, industrial waste management).

2. `question` – a precise, focused question whose answer can be explicitly and factually derived solely from the content of the provided document excerpt.

Your objective is to produce a concise, accurate, and semantically faithful answer explicitly grounded in the document content. Your response must not include any information that is inferred, assumed, generalized, or drawn from outside knowledge. You must preserve the exact phrasing, terminology (including domain-specific terms, proper names, program or law titles, and dates), and numerical values as presented in the document.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Comprehensive Reading  
   Thoroughly read and understand the entire `document_extracted` to grasp all relevant details, context, and nuances before attempting to answer.

2. Exact Extraction & Strict Grounding  
   Identify and extract only those segment(s) of the document directly and explicitly answering the question. The answer must be semantically equivalent to the source text without distortion, elaboration, or omission of critical details.

3. Terminology and Precision  
   - Retain key domain-specific terminology exactly as appears (e.g., “Industrial Waste Management Regulation of 2023,” “Technological Institute of Industrial Waste Management,” “plasma gasification,” “Digital Literacy for All initiative,” “Student Digital Privacy Act”).
   - Include exact names of institutions, experts, programs, legislation, policies, events, or technologies mentioned.
   - Numeric facts (dates, percentages, quantities) must be reproduced exactly as given—no rounding, approximating, or paraphrasing.
   - When quoting expert statements or critical quotes, reproduce them verbatim, enclosed in quotation marks.

4. Response Structure  
   Your final output must have two clear parts:  
   a) Reasoning — Briefly explain your reasoning process by referencing specific parts of the document that led to your answer (e.g., “The document states…”, “According to Dr. Susan Morley’s statement…”). This explanation should demonstrate how you located and interpreted the relevant passage(s).  
   b) Answer — Provide the direct, concise, and exact answer that addresses the question solely on documented content.

5. Tone and Scope  
   - Maintain an objective and factual tone throughout.  
   - Avoid any outside information, assumptions, inferences, or interpretations beyond the text.  
   - Avoid restating, summarizing unrelated content, or providing general background not explicitly requested.  
   - Do not add or remove information that alters the meaning of the original document excerpt.

6. Handling Unanswerable Questions  
   If the document does not explicitly contain the answer, respond precisely and unambiguously with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”

Generalizable Strategy:

- Focus your reading to pinpoint the specific segment(s) that answer the question rather than summarizing the entire document.  
- Align your terminology and phrasing exactly with those in the source text, preserving all nuances, especially for technical terms, names, and dates.  
- When the question requests numeric or date information, extract the exact figure or date as is.  
- Quote expert statements whenever central to the answer instead of paraphrasing.  
- Use your reasoning explanation to transparently demonstrate the logical document passage(s) supporting your answer.  
- Ensure that the answer part is a crisp, standalone response to the question without extra detail or qualification.

Purpose:  
These instructions ensure that your answers strictly align with the authoritative source content provided, maintaining domain-specific semantic fidelity, accuracy of data, and precise terminology necessary for technical, legislative, institutional, or other specialized domains.

Summary:

- Fully read and understand the entire `document_extracted`.  
- Extract exact passages that explicitly answer the question.  
- Provide a brief reasoning explanation citing document evidence.  
- Provide a concise, exact final answer using original terminology and precise data.  
- Use direct quotes where critical; reproduce names, policies, events, and dates exactly.  
- State explicitly if no answer is found.  
- Do not add or infer information beyond what is presented.

By following these detailed guidelines, your responses will be consistently precise, verifiable, and semantically faithful to the source document content.

You will be given two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a precise, domain-specific factual excerpt encompassing exact institutional names, dates, technical terminology, policies, expert statements, numerical data, events, and concrete examples strictly relevant to a narrowly defined subject.  
2. `question` – a direct query seeking a factual, explicit answer contained solely within the provided document excerpt.

Your task is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer strictly based on the explicit content of the `document_extracted`. Do not add any external knowledge, inference, or assumption beyond what is explicitly stated.

Detailed Task Description and Requirements:  
1. **Complete and careful reading:** Read the entire `document_extracted` thoroughly to understand all relevant content and context before answering.  
2. **Exact extraction:** Identify and extract only the minimal yet complete segment(s) from the document that directly answer the question. This may include institutional roles, specialized terminology, expert quotes, policies, legislation, dates, or numerical data as exactly presented.  
3. **Reasoning statement:** Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement citing or quoting the exact document segment(s) supporting the answer (e.g., “The document states: ‘…’”).  
4. **Concise final answer:** Provide a direct, precise final answer that strictly reflects the document’s explicit information without adding, modifying, or omitting critical details or emphasis. Use quotations when exact wording is necessary for accuracy.  
5. **Preservation of terminology and data:** Maintain all domain-specific terms, names of people, institutions, initiatives, specific techniques, policies, exact numbers, and dates exactly as given, including correct spelling and formatting, e.g., “October 15, 2023,” “salt block grilling technique,” or “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023.”  
6. **No external content or inference:** Do not introduce or imply any information not explicitly present in the document, even if widely known. Avoid generalizations or paraphrasing that dilute precise meanings.  
7. **If no explicit answer:** If the document does not contain a factual answer to the question, respond exactly with: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
8. **Tone and style:** Maintain an objective, factual tone with no commentary, speculation, or explanation beyond what the document states.  
9. **Avoid redundancy or verbosity:** Provide only the minimal factual fragments needed to answer the question fully and explicitly.  
10. **Numerical and date precision:** When numerical or date information is requested, supply the exact figures or dates as presented without rounding or rephrasing.

Domain-Specific Notes and Examples:  
- The task often involves fields with precise terminology (e.g., gastronomy: “salt block grilling technique,” cybersecurity: “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” or exact dates like “October 15, 2023”). Preserve these exactly.  
- Expert quotes or statements are to be presented verbatim if their precise wording is critical.  
- Named entities (people, institutions, programs) and policies must be reproduced exactly to maintain the document’s semantic accuracy.  
- When providing numerical or date answers, respond solely with the exact figure or date (e.g., “October 15, 2023.”), avoiding explanatory phrases unless they are part of a quote directly answering the question.

Reasoning and Final Answer Formatting:  
- Clearly separate the reasoning from the final answer. The reasoning should cite or quote exact document excerpts that underpin the answer.  
- The final answer must be as concise as possible while semantically faithful and complete in terms of critical factual content.

Examples of Common Errors to Avoid (Learned from Feedback):  
- Avoid inferring or infusing any knowledge not found verbatim or explicitly in the document, e.g., do not assume implications about food security, policy timelines, or cultural interpretations beyond what the text states.  
- Do not provide approximate or inferred dates or generalized statements if the document only contains vaguer or missing timing details; instead, acknowledge absence by stating: “The document does not specify…” or “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Avoid restating the entire paragraph if a brief direct quote or segment suffices; extract only the essential factual passages.  
- When a direct quote fully answers the question, reproduce it exactly rather than paraphrasing.  
- When the question asks for a fact or numeric data, do not supply explanations or context beyond the exact figure or text from the document.

Recommended Approach:  
- Thoroughly read the `document_extracted` to understand context and details.  
- Search precisely for the textual evidence that directly answers the question.  
- Extract minimal, exact textual fragments or precise data required.  
- Formulate a short reasoning citing these fragments.  
- Provide a concise, exact answer strictly grounded in the document.  
- If no answer is present, reply with “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Ensure terminology, names, dates, and numeric data match exactly the document’s forms.

This approach ensures authoritative, precise, and unambiguous answers that respect the specialized, factually sensitive nature of domain-specific queries where exact terms, details, and quotes are essential.

Task Overview:  
You will receive two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual, domain-specific document excerpt containing explicit and precise information such as institutional names, dates, policies, technical terms, expert statements, events, numerical data, and examples relevant to a specialized topic.  
2. `question` – a precise, focused question whose answer can be found explicitly and factually within only the content of the provided document.

Objective:  
Produce a concise, exact, and semantically faithful answer strictly grounded in the given document’s content without introducing any outside knowledge, inference, or speculation. Your answer must reflect exact phrasing, terminology, and numerical data as presented in the source.

Detailed Task Description:  
- Carefully read the entire `document_extracted` input to fully comprehend context and all provided details before attempting to answer.  
- Identify and extract only the text or information that explicitly and clearly answers the question, or reproduce that information closely mirroring the original wording and terminology. Do not include irrelevant details or alter the meaning in any way.  
- Use key domain-specific concepts, proper names (institutional titles, legislation, policies, experts, events), technical terms, and numerical data exactly as stated in the document.  
- Use direct quotations (enclosed in quotation marks) whenever the original phrasing or expert statements are critical to meaning or precision.  
- Provide precise numeric data (dates, percentages, quantities) exactly as they appear in the text. Do not round, approximate, paraphrase, or generalize numbers or dates.  
- Begin your response with a brief explanation of your reasoning process referencing the specific document segments supporting your answer (e.g., "The document states...", "According to X's statement in the passage...").  
- Follow your reasoning with a clear, concise final answer exactly addressing the question and drawn solely from the document content, maintaining semantic alignment and factual fidelity.  
- Answer only using information explicitly provided; if the document lacks an explicit answer, respond with "The answer is not found in the document."  
- Maintain an objective and factual tone throughout your response.

Best Practices and Strategies:  
- Focus strictly on pinpointing and extracting the precise segment(s) within the source that explicitly answer the question instead of summarizing unrelated sections or inferring implied details.  
- Retain exact domain-specific vocabularies and proper nouns exactly as they appear (e.g., “Industrial Waste Management Regulation of 2023,” “Student Digital Privacy Act,” “plasma gasification,” “Green Growth Fund,” etc.).  
- When the question requires numeric facts or dates, present those exact figures or dates without modification.  
- When expert statements or quotes are central, reproduce them verbatim in quotation marks to preserve accuracy.  
- For date or event-related queries, cite the exact date or event name found verbatim in the text.  
- Avoid restating or paraphrasing the information unless the document itself paraphrases it; preserve semantic fidelity and verifiability.  
- Distinguish between explicit answers and implied or inferred ones—only answer using explicit textual statements.  
- If the document provides the answer verbatim (e.g., "30%."), provide that exact text rather than rephrasing (“Attempted cyber attacks increased by 30%...”).  
- Avoid adding extra explanatory or background information beyond what the document explicitly states.  
- Do not summarize or combine multiple loosely related facts unless the document itself presents them in that manner.  
- Begin your answer with a brief reasoning statement explaining how the document supports the chosen answer, then provide the exact concise answer.

Purpose:  
These instructions ensure your answers strictly match the authoritative source content, preserving exact terminology, figures, and nuanced meanings necessary for accuracy in technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized domain questions. Your approach prioritizes textual fidelity, verifiability, and elimination of speculation or inference.

Summary:  
- Read entire document carefully.  
- Identify exact segment(s) that explicitly answer the question.  
- Briefly explain your reasoning referencing these segments.  
- Provide a concise, factual, direct answer using exact terms, numbers, and quotes where relevant.  
- Clearly state “The answer is not found in the document.” if no explicit answer exists.  
- Maintain objectivity and exact semantic alignment to source.

Input and Output Formats:  
- Input: Two parts — `document_extracted` (a factual domain-specific passage), and a precise `question`.  
- Output: Reasoning statement + Exact answer based strictly on `document_extracted` content.

By following these instructions carefully, you will produce answers that are semantically accurate, precise, factually verifiable, and fully consistent with the source document’s wording and data.

2025/11/20 21:03:46 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 18: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be provided with two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a factual, domain-specific excerpt containing precise information such as institutional names, dates, technical terms, policies, expert quotes, events, numerical data, and concrete examples related to a narrowly defined subject.  
2. `question` – a direct and precise query seeking a factual, explicit answer that is strictly contained within the provided document excerpt.

Your task is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer strictly grounded on the information explicitly present in the `document_extracted`, without adding any external knowledge, inference, or assumptions.

Key Requirements:

1. Comprehensive Reading:  
   Carefully read the entire `document_extracted` before answering to ensure full understanding of all context and factual content.

2. Exact Extraction of Supporting Text:  
   Identify and extract only the precise segment(s) of the document that directly answer the question, including all relevant factual details such as:  
   - Institutional names and roles (e.g., "Councilwoman Rebecca Gates")  
   - Specialized terminology and technical phrases (e.g., "salt block grilling technique", "CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023")  
   - Exact dates and numerical data without paraphrasing (e.g., “October 15, 2023.”)  
   - Expert statements or quotes, preserving original wording and punctuation exactly

3. Reasoning Statement:  
   Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement that cites or quotes the exact relevant portion(s) of the document which support the answer. This should clearly show which sentence(s) or phrase(s) justify the final response.

4. Concise, Direct Final Answer:  
   Following your reasoning, provide a concise, direct answer that strictly addresses the question using only the facts from the text, reproducing all critical factual elements exactly as given. Include quotations with quotation marks when preserving exact wording is essential.

5. Semantic Fidelity and Terminology:  
   Preserve domain-specific terms, official names, exact figures, specific dates, and special terminology as they appear in the source. Avoid generalizations, rephrasings, or any modifications that might dilute or alter the original meaning or emphasis of the source text.

6. Numerical and Date Precision:  
   If the question asks for numerical or date information, supply the exact figures or dates verbatim, avoiding rounding or paraphrasing.

7. Handling Absence of Answers:  
   If the document does not explicitly contain the factual answer to the question, respond clearly and unambiguously with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”

8. Objectivity and Factual Tone:  
   Maintain an objective, factual tone throughout. Do not speculate, infer, or provide commentary beyond the explicit content of the document.

9. Avoid Redundancy:  
   Extract the minimal but complete factual fragments sufficient to answer the question accurately and precisely, avoiding verbosity or unnecessary elaboration.

10. No External Knowledge:  
    Do not introduce any external or background knowledge, even if widely known or easily inferred. The answer must be strictly confined to the contents of the provided document excerpt.

Recommended Approach:

- Thoroughly read the entire provided document excerpt.
- Identify the minimal key sentences or phrases that directly answer the question.
- Quote or paraphrase these segments precisely in your reasoning statement.
- Formulate a concise final answer, reproducing key factual elements exactly, using direct quotations where appropriate.
- For questions requesting numbers or dates, include exactly those values without modification.
- If no answer is present, state so clearly and immediately.

Additional Domain-Specific Notes:

- Terminology and phrasing are critical. For instance, if the document uses phrases like “salt block grilling technique” or event names like “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” these must appear exactly as is.
- Named entities (people, institutions, initiatives), technical or policy terms, key dates, and expert quotes must be preserved verbatim to maintain semantic accuracy.
- The answer should reproduce the emphasis of the original document, especially regarding who said what, timing of events, or magnitude of numerical data.
- When a direct quote from the document is relevant to the question, use quotation marks to preserve the exact wording.
- Do not attempt to paraphrase answers if a direct phrase or quote from the document provides a clearer, more precise factual response.

This approach ensures answers are authoritative, precise, semantically accurate, and fully grounded in the source text, suitable for high-stakes, domain-specific queries where exact terminologies, dates, figures, and institutional references are critical.

2025/11/20 21:03:48 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 19: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description and Objective:  
You will be given two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual, domain-specific document excerpt containing precise institutional names, dates, policies, technical terms, expert statements, events, and detailed examples directly relevant to a focused topic.  
2. `question` – a concise, clearly defined question whose answer can be explicitly and factually derived solely from the given document.  

Your objective is to produce a concise, accurate, and semantically faithful answer strictly grounded in the document text. Your answer must reproduce exact terminologies, names, numerical data, dates, and quotations found in the document without introducing any external knowledge, inference, speculation, or paraphrasing that modifies the original meaning or precision.

Input Analysis and Approach:  
- Carefully and thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted` input to fully grasp context, details, and nuance before attempting to answer.  
- Identify the exact segment(s) of the document that explicitly and clearly answer the question. Avoid using implied, inferred, or general knowledge.  
- Extract and reuse or mirror verbatim the domain-specific terms, institutional names, policies, expert quotes, dates, numerical data, and key concepts as presented. Use direct quotation marks for any exact phrasing critical to meaning or precision.  
- For numeric facts (dates, percentages, counts), provide the exact figures from the document without rounding, approximating, or paraphrasing.  
- The answer must be factually and semantically aligned to the source, reflecting precise domain language and examples. Avoid adding explanatory background, context beyond what is essential for the answer, or summaries of unrelated material.  

Answer Structure and Tone:  
- Begin your response with a brief explanation of your reasoning process, explicitly referencing which part(s) of the document support your answer (e.g., "The document states...", "According to X’s statement…"). This shows how you located and confirmed your answer in the text.  
- Follow with a direct, succinct answer that addresses the question exactly and only with the documented content, reproducing important terminology, figures, and quotations verbatim when relevant.  
- Maintain an objective, factual tone throughout without speculation, personal opinions, or unverifiable claims.  
- If the document does not explicitly include the answer, respond precisely with “The answer is not found in the document.” Do not guess or infer beyond the text.  

Domain-Specific Notes:  
- The documents often include institutional titles (e.g., "Technological Institute of Industrial Waste Management," "Green Growth Fund"), policy/regulation names ("Industrial Waste Management Regulation of 2023," "Student Digital Privacy Act"), and technical terms ("plasma gasification," "equity financing," "microfinancing institutions"). Retain these exactly as they appear.  
- Expert statements or quotes critical to understanding must be reproduced verbatim within quotation marks.  
- Dates and events, including exact launch dates, approval dates, or occurrence dates (e.g., "October 15, 2023," "December 2"), are critical to precision and should be cited exactly.  
- Numeric values (e.g., "$10 million," "over 200 SMEs") must not be rounded or paraphrased.  
- When questions relate to event significance or program goals, include the specific language the document uses to describe these, rather than inferred implications.  

Best Practices and Strategies:  
- Prioritize locating the precise passage that directly answers the question before drafting the response.  
- Mirror the text's structure and wording closely, especially for key factual elements and terminology.  
- Use direct quotation marks around any critical phrasing that impacts meaning or clarity.  
- Avoid summarizing broad sections or including peripheral information not required to answer the question.  
- Provide a brief explanation referencing your source within the document to demonstrate traceability.  
- When quantifying or naming specific entities, maintain exactness to uphold the domain specificity and verifiability of the answer.  
- Clearly differentiate between explicit information and any text that only hints or suggests an answer—only use explicit content.  
- If no explicit answer is present, state “The answer is not found in the document.” rather than speculating.  

Purpose:  
These instructions ensure your answers strictly match the authoritative source content, preserving the exact terminology, figures, and nuanced meanings necessary for accuracy in technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized domains. Your approach must emphasize textual fidelity and verifiability, eliminating speculation, inference, or approximation.

Summary:  
- Thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted`.  
- Identify exact segment(s) that explicitly answer the question.  
- Briefly explain your reasoning by referencing parts of the document supporting your answer.  
- Provide a concise, factual answer using exact terms, numbers, names, dates, and direct quotes when relevant.  
- State “The answer is not found in the document.” if no explicit answer exists.  
- Maintain a neutral, factual tone and semantic alignment to the source text at all times.

2. `question` – a direct, narrowly scoped query answerable explicitly and factually strictly from the provided document, verbatim or nearly verbatim, without relying on any inference, external knowledge, or assumptions.

Your mission is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer strictly grounded in the document content, reproducing critical phrases, exact numbers, proper names, and domain-specific terminology exactly as they appear. You must not go beyond the document, add generalizations, reinterpretations, or assumptions.

Detailed Task Guidance:  
1. Carefully and thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted` before attempting to answer to fully grasp all relevant context and specifics.  
2. Locate explicitly the exact text segment(s) within the document that directly and fully answer the question posed.  
3. Extract, synthesize, and articulate the key factual elements clearly, including names, dates, expert statements/quotes, legislation or policy terms, technical language, numerical data (percentages, dates, quantities), and events exactly as presented.  
4. When exact wording is crucial (e.g., phrases conveying specific meaning or official terminology), quote directly with quotation marks to preserve semantic fidelity.  
5. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement referencing the exact portion(s) of the document on which the answer is based—e.g., "The document states that..." or "According to the text..."—to show the factual grounding of your answer.  
6. Provide a concise and direct final answer immediately after the reasoning statement that precisely addresses the question, without adding unrelated details, commentary, or external context.  
7. Numeric and date data must be provided exactly as stated, with no rounding, paraphrasing, or approximations.  
8. If the question cannot be answered explicitly from the document (no direct or implicit statement present), respond clearly and unambiguously with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”  
9. Maintain an objective, factual tone without speculation, inference, or personal interpretation.  
10. Avoid verbosity, generalizations, or dilutions of the original meaning. Always preserve original nuance, emphasis, and terminology.  

Common Effective Approach Employed:  
- Read the entire document to understand all details and context.  
- Search for direct textual evidence answering the question.  
- Highlight and extract only the minimal set of sentences or phrases that explicitly answer the question while preserving all critical details.  
- Frame a brief reasoning statement pointing explicitly to the source excerpt.  
- Produce a tightly focused, textually accurate, semantically faithful answer that uses direct quotes for key terms or statements when needed.  
- Provide precise numeric or date details exactly as stated.  
- Confirm when no valid answer is present by declaring the answer is not found in the document.  

Critical Domain-Specific and Instruction-Specific Elements:  
- Preserve proper names, institutional roles, expert titles, policy or legislation names verbatim as capitalized and presented.  
- Retain exact quotations around critical expert statements or policy terms where wording affects meaning.  
- Numeric facts (including percentages, dates, quantities) must not be approximated or generalized. For example, use “30%.” not “around 30%.” or “nearly 30%.”  
- Avoid paraphrasing when the original terminology or phraseology is necessary for technical accuracy.  
- The reasoning statement is mandatory and should reference the source passage explicitly to validate your answer.  
- The task demands objective, fact-based, domain-specific responses fit for high-stakes, technical, legislative, or institutional questions where precise terminology and exact data is essential.  

By adhering to these refined instructions, your answers will be authoritative, textually accurate, semantically precise, and strictly grounded on the presented document without any external input. This approach is crucial to maintain reliability and factual correctness in contexts involving detailed and complex domain-specific knowledge.

You will be given two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a domain-specific factual excerpt containing explicit, precise information including institutional names, dates, technical terms, policies, expert statements, events, numerical data, and concrete examples strictly relevant to a narrowly defined subject area.  
2. `question` – a direct, precise query whose factual answer, if present, is explicitly contained within the `document_extracted`.

Your responsibility is to produce a concise, semantically faithful, and factually accurate answer strictly grounded on the information explicitly and literally stated in the provided document excerpt, following these principles:

Core Requirements and Approach:  
1. **Comprehensive Reading:** Carefully read the full `document_extracted` to fully understand context, avoid overlooking crucial details that may influence the answer.  
2. **Exact Extraction:** Identify and extract only the minimal but complete factual segment(s) that directly and explicitly answer the question. Reproduce critical factual information exactly as found, including specialized terminology, institution names, expert quotes, dates, and numbers verbatim.  
3. **No External Knowledge or Inference:** Do not add any information, inference, assumptions, speculation, or background knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated in the document. If the document lacks a direct factual answer, respond exactly:  
   > “The answer is not found in the document.”  
4. **Precise Quotation:** When the exact wording is important for preserving accuracy (e.g., expert quotes, definitions), use direct quotations with quotation marks as presented.  
5. **Numerical and Date Data:** Provide exact numeric or date data as given, verbatim, without rounding, paraphrasing, or omission (e.g., “November 1, 2023.” not “early November”).  
6. **Concise and Focused:** Avoid redundancy, verbosity, or irrelevant contextual details. Your answer must be the minimal sufficient factual fragment(s) that address the question in full.  
7. **Maintaining Semantic Fidelity:** Preserve all domain-specific terms and nuances from the source. Do not dilute key concepts, omit institutional roles, or alter emphases.  
8. **Objective, Neutral Tone:** Maintain a purely factual and objective tone. No commentary, summary, or explanation beyond citing supporting text and stating the final answer.

Detailed Response Structure:  
- Start by providing a brief reasoning statement that references or quotes the exact segment(s) of the document supporting your answer, e.g., quoting authoritative phrases or sentences that contain the answer.  
- Follow with a concise final answer that directly responds to the question, strictly grounded on that supporting text.  
- If you must quote, preserve original punctuation and capitalization exactly.

Domain-Specific Considerations:  
- Specialized terminology matters deeply; for example, phrases like “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” or institutional names like “National Cyber Security Alliance” must be rendered exactly.  
- Named entities (people, institutions, initiatives), expert statements or titles, precise dates, and numerical data must be reproduced verbatim to maintain accuracy and semantic integrity.  
- Contextual or explanatory background is only to be included if it is part of the minimal factually necessary segments that answer the question.

Handling Unanswerable Questions:  
If the document does not *explicitly* contain a direct factual answer to the posed question—even if related or suggestive material is present—your response must be exactly:  
> “The answer is not found in the document.”

Avoid extrapolations or attempts to synthesize implicit meanings.

Summary:  
- Fully comprehend the document.  
- Extract minimal but sufficient explicit text answering the question.  
- Reference the supporting text in your reasoning.  
- Provide a concise, precise final answer strictly based on the document.  
- Use exact terminology, numeric data, dates, and quotations as given.  
- If no explicit answer exists, respond with "The answer is not found in the document."  
- Keep factual objectivity and semantic fidelity paramount.

This approach ensures generation of authoritative, domain-accurate, and semantically precise answers tailored for high-stakes, narrowly focused factual queries requiring exact terminologies, dates, figures, and institutional references.

2025/11/20 21:04:39 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 22: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:  
You will be given two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a fact-rich, domain-specific excerpt containing precise institutional names, expert quotes, dates, technical terms, policies, numerical data, and concrete examples relevant to a narrowly defined subject. The excerpt can contain multiple paragraphs, detailed narratives, and specific events with exact dates, names, and terminology.  
2. `question` – a direct, precise query seeking a factual answer strictly contained within the provided document excerpt.

Your goal is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer strictly extracted and grounded on the explicit information within the provided document. Your response must neither add any external or inferred knowledge nor omit any critical factual details relevant to the question.

Detailed Instructions and Key Requirements:  

1. **Thorough Document Comprehension:**  
   Carefully read the entire `document_extracted` to fully understand context and specific details. Avoid premature answers that miss relevant information occurring later in the text.  

2. **Precise Extraction of Relevant Text:**  
   Identify only the exact segment(s) that explicitly answer the question. Extract all crucial factual elements such as:  
   - Exact institutional names and official titles (e.g., “GlobalFinance Corp.,” “University of Gastronomy,” “Earth Table”)  
   - Named individuals along with their correct titles and roles (e.g., “Jessica Sanders, a high school biology teacher,” “Dr. Rosalind Chu, esteemed chemist”)  
   - Exact dates and numerical data as given (e.g., “September 15, 2023,” “PS500,” “October 12”) without rounding or paraphrasing  
   - Specific expert quotes that are pertinent to the question, preserving punctuation and casing exactly  
   - Specialized technical or policy terms and domain-specific terminology (e.g., “salt block grilling technique,” “AR-powered learning modules,” “expense reconciliation”)  
   - Concrete examples or events directly related to the question  

3. **Begin with a Brief Reasoning Statement:**  
   Include a short statement that references or quotes verbatim the supporting excerpt(s) to justify your final answer. This shows the factual grounding for your response. For example, quote or paraphrase the exact phrase(s) that contain critical facts.  

4. **Concise, Direct, and Complete Final Answer:**  
   Provide a brief final answer that addresses the question fully and accurately. The answer must:  
   - Reproduce critical factual information exactly as stated in the document  
   - Use direct quotations when exact wording is key to preserving accuracy or emphasis  
   - Avoid generalizations, dilution, or omission of significant details  
   - Avoid redundancy or verbosity; use minimal text sufficient to answer fully  

5. **Numeric and Date Data:**  
   When the question asks for numbers or dates, report them exactly as presented (e.g., “October 15, 2023.” not “mid-October” or “around October”) without added commentary.  

6. **Handling Absence of Answer:**  
   If the document does not explicitly contain a factual answer to the question, respond exactly with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”  

7. **Maintain Objectivity and Neutrality:**  
   Your answer must be purely factual without any speculation, inference, editorializing, or commentary beyond what the document states.  

8. **Domain-Specific Terminology and Entities:**  
   Because domain terminology and named entities are pivotal, always replicate them verbatim. For example, “salt block grilling technique,” “eco-conscious restaurant ‘Earth Table’,” “AR-powered learning modules,” “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023.”  
   Similarly, preserve direct quotes fully and precisely as given, since subtle changes can alter meaning or emphasis.  

9. **Leverage Key Phrases or Quotes From the Document to Improve Semantic Fidelity:**  
   When appropriate, use direct quotes to reflect the document’s emphasis and nuance. Refrain from paraphrasing if the exact wording conveys critical meaning or interpretation related to the question.  

10. **Avoid Introducing External or Inferred Knowledge:**  
    The answer must rely strictly on explicit information from the document. Even if the question might be commonly understood elsewhere, do not provide anything unless it appears in the provided text.  

Recommended Approach:  
- Thoroughly read the entire document excerpt to capture every relevant detail.  
- Locate and highlight the exact phrases and data that explicitly answer the question; do not infer or generalize beyond them.  
- Construct a brief reasoning that cites these supporting text segments.  
- Write a concise answer that faithfully reproduces all critical information exactly as given.  
- When quoting, use quotation marks only when the exact wording is essential.  
- Use precise numeric or temporal data directly from the document.  
- If an answer is absent, state “The answer is not found in the document.” in compliance with requirement.  

Purpose of This Task:  
This task is intended for handling high-stakes, precise knowledge retrieval in domain-specific contexts where exact terminology, names, dates, figures, policies, and expert statements matter. The answers must be authoritative and accurate, maintaining semantic fidelity to the source to support critical decision-making or knowledge validation.  

Avoid common pitfalls such as:  
- Summarizing or rephrasing the content in a way that loses critical specificity or nuances  
- Providing inferred or background information not present in the document  
- Omitting precise dates, numbers, or direct quotes required by the question  
- Being verbose or redundant rather than minimal and exact  

This carefully disciplined method ensures precise, trustworthy responses based solely on the document’s explicitly provided information, preserving domain integrity and factual correctness.

You will be provided two inputs for each query:  
1. `document_extracted` – a detailed, coherent factual excerpt containing precise domain-specific information, including named entities (people, institutions, countries), dates, policies, laws, numerical data, technical terms, quotations, events, or specialized concepts relevant to a narrowly focused subject area.  
2. `question` – a narrowly scoped, fact-based question that must be answered exclusively with information explicitly stated or nearly verbatim in the `document_extracted`. Your answer must not rely on inference, external knowledge, or assumptions.

Your goal is to produce a concise, semantically faithful, and textually accurate answer strictly grounded in the provided document content. Key domain-specific terms, exact numbers, dates, expert quotes, and official terminology must be reproduced exactly as they appear. Avoid paraphrasing or generalizing when the original wording is important for accuracy or emphasis.

Detailed Instructions:  
1. Carefully and thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted` to understand the full context and all relevant factual details before attempting an answer.  
2. Identify the exact text segment(s) within the document that explicitly and fully answer the question.  
3. Extract and synthesize only the minimal necessary information that directly answers the question, preserving key factual elements such as names, dates, roles, legislation or policy names, technical terms, expert quotes in quotation marks, and numerical data exactly as stated.  
4. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement that explicitly references the document passage(s) supporting your answer, such as:  
   - "The document states that..."  
   - "According to the text..."  
   - "The document explicitly mentions..."  
   This establishes clear factual grounding and transparency of your source.  
5. Provide a concise, direct answer immediately after the reasoning statement without adding unrelated details or commentary.  
6. Use direct quotations around critical phrases or terminology when exact wording conveys specific or official meaning.  
7. Include numeric facts, percentages, dates, and quantities precisely as written; do not paraphrase or approximate them.  
8. If the question cannot be answered explicitly or implicitly from the document, respond unambiguously:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”  
9. Maintain an objective, factual tone strictly based on the document; avoid speculation, inference, or personal interpretation.  
10. Avoid verbosity or diluting the original nuance or emphasis. Never add generalized language or omit qualified terms.

Effective Reasoning and Answering Approach:  
- Read entire document to fully grasp context.  
- Search for direct, explicit evidence answering the question.  
- Extract only the minimal, relevant excerpts or phrases that completely answer the query.  
- State a brief reasoning sentence referencing this explicit source text.  
- Deliver a tightly focused, textually accurate, domain-specific answer incorporating proper names, dates, expert statements, and numerical data exactly.  
- Use direct quotes for phrases where precise wording is crucial.  
- Confirm when no valid answer exists by explicitly stating so.

Critical Domain-Specific Elements to Preserve:  
- Proper names, titles, institutional roles, laws, or policy names: retain them verbatim as capitalized in the document.  
- Expert statements or official terminology: quote exactly when wording matters for meaning or emphasis.  
- Numerical data (percentages, dates, quantities): reproduce exactly as stated, with no rounding or paraphrasing.  
- Avoid paraphrasing when the original phrasing conveys specific legal, technical, or institutional meaning.

Purpose of This Task:  
To provide authoritative, accurate, and semantically faithful answers grounded solely on the provided factual excerpt. These responses are aimed at contexts requiring precision, reliability, and domain-specific correctness (e.g., high-stakes technical, legislative, institutional, or academic questions).

By strictly following these detailed instructions, your answers will maintain semantic fidelity, factual correctness, and strict textual grounding, ensuring trustworthiness and clarity in complex, domain-specific scenarios.

2025/11/20 21:05:31 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 24: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will receive two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a single, coherent, factual document excerpt containing detailed, domain-specific information. This excerpt may include precise terminology, expert statements in quotation marks, exact dates, institutional names, numerical data, policies, laws, programs, events, and technical details from a specialized topic domain (e.g., education policy, digital marketing, quantum computing, cybersecurity).

2. `question` – a precise, focused question whose answer is explicitly and factually contained within the document_extracted.

Your task is to provide a concise, accurate, and semantically faithful answer strictly based on the document_extracted content. Your response must not include any inferred, assumed, or outside knowledge, and must preserve the exact wording, terminology, and numerical values from the document.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Comprehensive Reading  
   - Fully read and understand the entire document_extracted before answering.  
   - Identify the exact portion(s) that explicitly answer the question without adding, omitting, or altering critical details.

2. Exact Extraction and Strict Grounding  
   - Extract only the text or data directly and explicitly answering the question.  
   - Do not summarize, paraphrase, or interpret beyond the document’s explicit content.  
   - If the document does not explicitly provide an answer, respond exactly:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

3. Terminology and Precision  
   - Retain original domain-specific terminology exactly as in the document (including names of laws, programs, institutions, technologies, expert quotes, dates, percentages, and numeric figures).  
   - Reproduce critical expert statements verbatim within quotation marks if they are essential to the answer.  
   - Include exact numeric data as given (no rounding or approximation).  
   - Preserve capitalization, punctuation, and spelling as in the source.

4. Response Structure  
   Your output consists of two distinct parts, demarcated clearly:  

   a) Reasoning  
      - Briefly explain how and where in the document you located the answer.  
      - Cite or reference specific phrases, sentences, or expert statements from the document that justify your extracted answer.   
      - Use an objective and factual tone, illustrating your interpretive process strictly from the text.

   b) Answer  
      - Provide a concise, standalone, direct answer strictly grounded in the document.  
      - Ensure the answer is semantically equivalent to the original text fragment(s).  
      - Do not add commentary, unrelated details, or reword the answer beyond exact phrases found in the document.

5. Handling Numeric or Date Questions  
   - When asked for values (e.g., percentages, dates), provide only the exact numeral or date as it appears in the document without any extra words or interpretation beyond what is needed to keep the answer complete and self-contained.

6. Avoiding Over-Extension  
   - Do not infer implications or extend answers beyond the document's explicit statements.  
   - Do not include background information, summaries, or unrelated content.  
   - If the question is unanswerable within document-extracted content, respond clearly with “The answer is not found in the document.”

Generalizable Strategy:

- Prioritize identifying precise, verbatim excerpts from the document that directly respond to the question.  
- Use explicit expert quotations or named references when pivotal to answer accuracy.  
- Retain original wording and domain-specific phrases to maintain semantic fidelity.  
- Keep the reasoning transparent but succinct, demonstrating direct textual support for your answer.  
- Distinguish clearly between your reasoning and final answer to maintain clarity and correctness.

Purpose:

These instructions guarantee your output is rigorously factual, domain-specific, semantically faithful, and precise based solely on the supplied document excerpt, ensuring trustworthiness and verifiability in technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized contexts.

Summary:

- Thoroughly comprehend the entire document_extracted.  
- Extract the exact passage(s) that explicitly and fully answer the question.  
- Provide a brief reasoning citing exact document evidence.  
- Provide a concise, precise final answer using the original terminology and data as-is.  
- Use exact quotes for critical content.  
- State “The answer is not found in the document.” if the answer is absent.  
- Avoid inference, addition, omission, or summarization beyond the explicit document content.

By following these detailed guidelines, all responses will be consistently precise, verifiable, and faithful to authoritative source content across diverse specialized domains.

You will be provided with two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a factual, domain-specific excerpt containing detailed, precise information featuring institutional names, dates, technical terms, policies, expert statements, events, numerical data, and concrete examples that pertain to a narrowly scoped subject.  
2. `question` – a direct and specific query whose factual, explicit answer is strictly available within the `document_extracted`.

Your task is to produce a concise, semantically faithful, factual answer strictly grounded on the explicit information in the provided document excerpt, following these detailed requirements:

Detailed Task Requirements:  
1. Carefully read the entire document to fully understand all context and content before addressing the question.  
2. Locate and extract only the minimal but complete fragment(s) of text that directly answer the question, reproducing all key factual elements exactly as presented in the document.  
3. Begin your response with a brief but clear reasoning statement referencing or quoting the exact supporting sentence(s) or phrase(s) from the document that justify your answer.  
4. Provide a concise, direct final answer strictly based on the document, avoiding irrelevant information, extraneous context, or any alteration to meaning or emphasis.  
5. Retain semantic fidelity by reproducing all specialized technical terms, named entities (people, institutions, initiatives), policies, dates, and numerical data exactly as given. Use direct quotes whenever preserving exact wording is necessary for accuracy or emphasis.  
6. When numerical or date data are requested, provide them exactly as in the document—no paraphrasing, rounding, or approximate wording.  
7. If the document does not contain an explicit answer to the question, respond unambiguously: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
8. Maintain an objective and factual tone throughout; do not speculate, infer, or offer any commentary beyond the document’s facts.  
9. Avoid verbosity and redundancy by extracting only the minimal complete factual segments sufficient to answer the question fully.  
10. Do not introduce any external knowledge or background, even if commonly known or logically inferred—base answers solely on the document content.

Domain-Specific and Style Notes:  
- Preserve exact phrasing of domain-specific terminology (e.g., “salt block grilling technique,” “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” “eco-conscious restaurant ‘Earth Table’,” or precise dates like “October 15, 2023”).  
- Maintain accuracy with institutional titles, personal names, specific project names, legislation, expert quotes, or numerical values unaltered.  
- When a quotation from the document is pertinent to the question, include it in quotation marks to preserve nuance and precision.  
- Focus on precision rather than generalization: retain details about who said what, timing, numerical magnitudes, project names, and other critical specifics as explicitly presented.  
- Numeric or date answers must be exact, standalone (e.g., “October 15, 2023.” not “mid-October 2023”).  
- The final answer should be clear, concise, and semantically consistent with the source, fulfilling high-stakes domain-specific query needs.  

Recommended Approach:  
- Read the entire `document_extracted` carefully to grasp full context and relevant data.  
- Identify exact text snippets that provide the precise answer without introducing anything new.  
- Write a brief reasoning statement citing these snippets verbatim or closely paraphrased but faithful to the original wording.  
- Provide a focused, concise answer that directly addresses the question.  
- Use direct quotations for exact language where necessary to preserve accuracy.  
- Report requested numerical or date information exactly as is.  
- If answer is not explicitly present, respond with “The answer is not found in the document.”

This approach ensures your answers are authoritative, precise, reliable, and perfectly aligned to the original factual source material, which is crucial for domain-specific, high-stakes question answering where precision and terminological exactness are essential.

2025/11/20 21:06:21 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 26: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be provided with two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a single coherent, factual excerpt from a specialized domain document. It contains detailed, domain-specific information, including exact names of institutions, programs, laws, dates, policies, specialized terminology, expert quotes, numerical data, event details, and precise examples directly related to a particular focused topic (such as education, climate policy, folklore studies, technology initiatives, etc.).

2. `question` – a precise, narrowly focused question that can be explicitly and factually answered using only the information contained in the given document excerpt.

Your goal is to produce a clear, concise, and semantically faithful answer that is strictly grounded in the content of the provided `document_extracted`. Your response must:

- Not include any inferred, assumed, generalized, or external knowledge.
- Preserve exact terminology, including proper names, program titles, legislation, events, domain-specific terms, and all numerical data exactly as in the source.
- When expert statements or critical quotes are relevant, reproduce them verbatim and enclosed in quotation marks.
- Avoid adding, removing, or altering meaning by omitting or rephrasing critical information.
- Be a short, standalone answer directly addressing the question.
- If the answer is not explicitly stated anywhere in the document, respond exactly with:  
  “The answer is not found in the document.”

Key Instructions:

1. Comprehensive Reading  
   Carefully and thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted`, identifying precise and relevant segments that explicitly answer the question.

2. Exact Extraction & Strict Grounding  
   Extract only the text segments that directly and explicitly answer the question, ensuring semantic equivalence and no distortion, omission, or elaboration beyond what is presented.

3. Terminology and Precision

2025/11/20 21:06:50 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 27: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be provided with two inputs:

1. `document_extracted`: This is a single, coherent, factual excerpt from a domain-specific document. The excerpt contains detailed, specialized information including but not limited to institutional names, exact dates, official policies or regulations, precise technical terms, expert statements (sometimes quoted verbatim), events, initiatives, numerical data (such as exact dates, percentages, quantities), and named examples directly related to a focused, specialized topic. Topics can range across diverse specialized domains such as education policy, cultural heritage preservation, environmental technology, industrial waste management, community theater inclusivity, or any other specific field.

2. `question`: A precise, focused question whose answer is explicitly and factually contained within the given `document_extracted`. The question requires an answer strictly grounded in the provided document, without relying on any external knowledge, inference, assumptions, or generalizations.

Objective:

Produce a concise, accurate, and semantically faithful answer that is explicitly grounded solely in the information presented within the `document_extracted`. Your answer must precisely preserve the original terminology, names, numbers, quotations, and phrasing as they occur in the document excerpt.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Comprehensive Reading:  
   Thoroughly read and understand the entire `document_extracted` before attempting to answer. Identify the exact portions that explicitly answer the question.

2. Exact Extraction and Strict Grounding:  
   - The answer must be formulated by directly extracting or closely paraphrasing only the explicit content found in the document.  
   - Do not infer, add, generalize, or introduce any information not explicitly stated.  
   - If the document does not contain the requested information fully or explicitly, respond clearly with:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

3. Terminology and Precision:  
   - Use the exact key domain-specific terminology, including proper nouns such as program, policy, law titles, institutional names (e.g., “Industrial Waste Management Regulation of 2023,” “Technological Institute of Industrial Waste Management”), technical terms (e.g., “plasma gasification,” “bio-remediation”), and named persons or experts exactly as written.  
   - Reproduce all dates, figures, and numerical data exactly as given (no rounding, approximations, or substitutions).  
   - When including expert statements or critical quotes, reproduce them verbatim and enclose in quotation marks.

4. Response Structure:  
   Your response must contain two clearly labeled parts:  
   a) Reasoning — Briefly explain your reasoning process by referencing specific parts or statements in the document that led you to the answer. For example, “The document states…,” “According to Dr. Susan Morley’s statement…,” or “The section on education and training indicates…”  
   This section should transparently show how you located and interpreted the relevant passage(s) supporting your answer.  
   b) Answer — Provide the direct, concise, exact answer grounded in the document, containing only the necessary information responding to the question, without extraneous details or qualifications.

5. Tone and Scope:  
   - Maintain a neutral, objective, and factual tone.  
   - Avoid any outside knowledge or interpretations beyond what the document states.  
   - Do not restate unrelated or irrelevant parts of the document or provide any background information unless explicitly requested.  
   - Keep the answer crisp and focused, containing only what is strictly necessary.

6. Handling Unanswerable Questions:  
   - If no explicit answer is found, reply exactly with:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

Generalizable Strategy:

- Focus your initial reading on pinpointing the explicit segments of text that clearly and directly answer the posed question rather than summarizing or broadly paraphrasing the entire document.  
- Align your language strictly with the terminology and phrasing used in the document excerpt, preserving all exact names, dates, technical terms, and numeric information.  
- When expert quotes or critical statements are pivotal, reproduce them verbatim within quotation marks.  
- Use your reasoning to transparently demonstrate how the selected text supports the answer.  
- Deliver the answer as a standalone response strictly derived from the document.

Purpose:

These instructions ensure that responses are consistently precise, verifiable, and semantically faithful to the authoritative source content. By doing so, answers will retain domain-specific accuracy, preserve critical factual detail, and maintain the integrity necessary for specialized technical, legislative, institutional, or scholarly domains.

Summary:

- Fully read and understand the entire input document.  
- Extract exact passages explicitly answering the question.  
- Present a brief reasoning explanation citing document evidence.  
- Provide a concise, exact final answer using original terminology and exact numeric values.  
- Use direct quotations when critical; preserve named entities and technical terms.  
- State explicitly “The answer is not found in the document.” when applicable.  
- Do not add or infer any information beyond what is present.

2025/11/20 21:08:07 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 30: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be given two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual excerpt from a domain-specific document. This text includes precise details such as expert statements (quoted verbatim), dates, technical terms, institutional or program names, numeric data, policies, laws, or explicit facts related to specialized topics (e.g., education technology, corporate finance, autonomous vehicles, SME funding). The excerpt is authoritative and structured with clearly demarcated sections or paragraphs covering different facets of the topic.

2. `question` – a concise, narrowly focused question whose answer is explicitly and fully contained in the `document_extracted`.

Your goal is to extract from the document an exact, semantically faithful, and complete answer that is strictly grounded in the text provided. Your answer must:

- Fully and directly reply to the question using only the explicit information or quotations present in the document excerpt.

- Avoid paraphrasing, summarizing, rewording, interpreting, inferring, omitting, or adding any detail beyond what the document states.

- Preserve original wording, punctuation, capitalization, terminology, numeric data, and expert quoted statements verbatim.

- Provide numeric or date answers exactly as they appear in the document, without rounding or abbreviation.

If the document does not explicitly contain the answer to the question, reply exactly:

“The answer is not found in the document.”

Instructions for Your Process:

1. Careful Comprehension  
   - Read the entire `document_extracted` carefully to understand its full context and to locate precise text segments that explicitly answer the question.

2. Precise Localization of Answer  
   - Identify the exact sentence(s) or passage(s) within the document that fully and explicitly respond to the question.
   - This may include technical terms, expert quotes in quotation marks, numeric data, dates, names, or complete factual statements.

3. Exact Extraction  
   - Extract only the relevant fragment(s) that fully answer the question.
   - Retain complete original wording, formatting, punctuation, domain-specific terminology, and named quotes without any alteration.
   - Do not omit any critical detail or divide partial sentences as long as the extraction fully answers the question.

4. Handling Absence of Data  
   - If no explicit answer exists in the document, do not guess or infer; respond exactly:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

5. Output Format  
   - Your response must be composed of two clear parts, separated distinctly:

   a) Reasoning  
      - Briefly explain how and where you found the explicit answer in the `document_extracted`.  
      - Reference the exact section, sentence(s), or expert quote that contain the answer.  
      - Use an objective and factual tone, clearly linking the extracted answer to the question and its source text.  
      - Keep this explanation succinct, transparent, and strictly based on the document.

   b) Answer  
      - Provide an exact, concise, standalone textual excerpt from the `document_extracted` that fully answers the question.  
      - Preserve all original domain-specific terminology, quoted expert wording, numeric values, dates, and formatting exactly.  
      - Do not add explanation, external information, summary, or rephrasing.

Generalizable Strategy to Apply:

- Scrutinize the document to locate the explicit textual evidence directly addressing the question—pay attention to dates, expert attributions, named programs, and numeric details.

- Extract complete sentences or relevant contiguous phrases precisely as they appear, ensuring semantic completeness without omission.

- Always check if the answer is explicitly stated before extracting; avoid assumptions or filling gaps with inferred details.

- When expert statements are critical, reproduce these verbatim within quotation marks exactly as presented.

- If multiple explicit fragments are necessary for a full answer, extract all relevant parts – do not limit to the first partial phrase.

- If multiple closely linked details are necessary, ensure they come directly from the text and maintain original order and wording.

Purpose:

These instructions ensure factually precise, authoritative, domain-specific answers that maintain semantic fidelity and verifiability purely based on the provided document. This is crucial for specialized, technical, legislative, or institutional contexts demanding exact referencing and avoiding any AI-generated inference or paraphrase.

Summary:

- Read and understand the entire provided document excerpt carefully.  
- Locate the exact segment that explicitly answers the question fully and literally.  
- Extract and present only the precise text(s) that answer the question, preserving all original facts, numbers, quotes, names, and terminologies.  
- If answer is missing, respond exactly with “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Provide a brief reasoning statement citing exact locations or quotations demonstrating how you identified the answer.  
- Avoid adding, inferring, summarizing, or interpreting beyond the given content.  
- Maintain all formatting, punctuation, and quoting intact.  
- Structure your output into a "Reasoning" and "Answer" section clearly.

By applying this rigorous extraction methodology, every response will maintain the highest standards of factual and domain-specific accuracy, essential for expert use cases requiring strict verification and traceability.

2025/11/20 21:08:47 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 32: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:
You will be provided with two inputs:
1. `document_extracted`: A detailed, coherent, and factually rich excerpt containing exact domain-specific information, including named entities (people, institutions, locations), dates, direct quotations, numerical data (percentages, dates, quantities), official terminology, policies, technical language, and/or tightly scoped event descriptions. The content is factual and precise, reflecting a narrow subject focus, such as legislative text, institutional policies, technical reports, or specialized research summaries.
2. `question`: A direct, narrowly scoped query that must be strictly answered from the provided document alone. The answer should be explicit in the text, either verbatim or nearly verbatim, with no reliance on inference, outside knowledge, assumptions, or reinterpretations.

Your task is to produce a concise, semantically faithful, and factually precise answer that strictly reflects the information presented in `document_extracted`.

Detailed Task Guidance:  
1. Read the entire `document_extracted` thoroughly to understand the context and all relevant details before answering.
2. Identify the exact sentence(s) or phrase(s) within the document that explicitly and fully answer the question.
3. Extract and synthesize these key factual elements, preserving proper names, institutional titles, technical terms, policy titles, quotations, numerical and date data exactly as presented.
4. Use direct quotations with quotation marks when exact wording is crucial to maintain semantic fidelity (e.g., terms with precise legal, technical, or institutional significance).
5. Your answer must be concise and tightly focused, containing only the minimal information needed to fully address the question. Avoid verbosity, generalizations, or extraneous details.
6. Numeric and date data must appear exactly as in the document, without rounding, paraphrasing, or approximation.
7. The reasoning statement must be included immediately before the answer. This statement must explicitly cite or reference the exact excerpt(s) of `document_extracted` that justify your answer to demonstrate objective grounding.
8. If the document does not provide a direct or implicit answer to the question, respond unambiguously with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”
9. Maintain an objective, factual tone without speculation, inference, or personal interpretation.
10. Avoid adding any external information, assumptions, or context not strictly present in the document.
11. Your response should be suitable for high-stakes, domain-specific settings such as legal, legislative, scientific, or institutional contexts where precision, faithfulness, and reliability are paramount.

Common Effective Approach:  
- Carefully read the entire excerpt to understand the full context and details.  
- Search explicitly for direct textual evidence answering the question.  
- Select and extract only those minimal sentence(s) or phrase(s) that explicitly respond to the question.  
- Formulate a brief reasoning statement referencing the document passage(s) that support the answer.  
- Provide a semantically faithful, precise answer using exact phrases, proper names, quotations, and numerical data from the document.  
- Confirm and state clearly if no valid answer exists within the text.

Critical Domain-Specific and Instruction-Specific Elements:
- Preserve exact capitalization and phrasing of named entities (people, institutions, countries), official policy or legislation titles, and specialized technical terminology.  
- Use quotation marks around all critical direct quotes that bear specific semantic meaning.  
- Provide exact figures, percentages, dates, and quantities with no alterations.  
- Do not paraphrase or summarize when the original wording is necessary for technical or legal accuracy.  
- The reasoning statement must explicitly cite the location or content in the document that validates the final answer.

This instruction set ensures that responses are authoritative, textually accurate, semantically precise, and strictly document-grounded. It mitigates risks of misinterpretation, speculation, or information dilution in contexts requiring utmost fidelity to source material.

   - Domain-specific technical terms, official phrases, and quotations crucial to meaning, which must be reproduced verbatim or in exact quotation marks.  
4. Produce a short reasoning statement that explicitly references the relevant portion(s) of the document which justify the answer, e.g., "The document states that..." or "According to the text..."  
5. Provide a concise, direct final answer that strictly addresses the question using text grounded only in the document. Avoid adding commentary, interpretations, or unrelated details.  
6. If there is no explicit or implicit answer in the document relevant to the question, respond exactly with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”  
7. Maintain an objective, factual tone and avoid speculation, inference, generalizations, or dilution of the original meaning.  
8. Avoid verbosity; your response should be succinct yet fully accurate and faithful to the source.  
9. In technical or legislative contexts, preserve precise terminology and phrasing as accuracy is paramount.  
10. Numeric and date information must be reported exactly as in the document (no paraphrasing or conversion).  
11. When quoting, use quotation marks around critical phrases or expert statements to preserve semantic integrity.

Effective Approach to Answering:  
- Read the entire document first to ensure comprehensive understanding.  
- Search explicitly for exact or nearly exact sentences or phrases that directly answer the posed question.  
- Highlight the minimal relevant text with full critical details and terminology preserved verbatim.  
- Construct a brief, explicit reasoning statement referencing the source passage.  
- Provide a concise and exact final answer faithfully reflecting the document.  
- If no direct answer exists, explicitly state “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Maintain strict adherence to factual correctness and domain-specific precision without extrapolation.

Key Domain-Specific and Task-Specific Elements to Preserve:  
- Proper nouns including full official names of people, institutions, laws, initiatives, projects, and place names as exactly presented.  
- Exact dates in day-month-year or otherwise precise formats exactly as stated.  
- Explicit numerical values including percentages, quantities, and timelines without approximation.  
- Specialized terminology and official policy or legislation wording, retaining original phrases and quotations intact.

2025/11/20 21:09:33 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 34: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:  
You will be given two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a detailed and coherent excerpt rich in explicit, domain-specific factual content including but not limited to named entities (people, institutions, countries), exact dates, technical terms, numerical data, legislation or policy names, quotations, and specialized concepts directly relevant to a tightly scoped subject area.  
2. `question` – a focused, specific query that asks for a factually and explicitly stated piece of information within the provided document, without requiring inference, implicit interpretation, or outside knowledge.

Your objective is to produce a concise, textually faithful answer strictly derived from the document content. The output must:  
- Accurately reproduce any critical phrases, official terminology, expert quotes, exact numbers, dates, and named entities verbatim or nearly verbatim, preserving original wording wherever that conveys specialized meaning or nuance.  
- Avoid any addition of assumptions, generalizations, paraphrases, or reinterpretations that could alter meaning, dilute specificity, or introduce external information.  
- Focus exclusively on the minimal, direct excerpt(s) from the document that entirely answer the question.  

Detailed Guidelines:  
1. Fully read and comprehend the entire `document_extracted` before formulating an answer to ensure complete context.  
2. Identify and extract the smallest set of explicit text segments that provide a complete, direct answer to the question. Include all key factual details necessary for a precise response.  
3. For all critical terminology, policy names, roles, titles, and quoted statements where wording impacts meaning, preserve the original wording by quoting exactly with double quotation marks.  
4. Provide exact numeric and date data identically as stated (e.g., “30%.” not “around 30%,” “October 15, 2023.” not “mid-October.”).  
5. Begin your answer with a brief reasoning statement, explicitly referencing the exact part(s) of the document that ground your response (e.g., “The document states that...,” or “According to the text...”); this shows your answer’s factual basis.  
6. Immediately follow with a concise, targeted final answer, without unrelated information, commentary, speculation, or extraneous details.  
7. If the document does not explicitly or implicitly provide an answer, respond unambiguously:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”  
8. Maintain an objective, factual, domain-specific tone throughout. Avoid verbosity, generalizations, or dilutions of original meaning.  
9. Focus on semantic fidelity, minimizing textual distance from original document when presenting the core answer.  

Effective Approach Recommendations (Based on Prior Examples and Feedback):  
- Start by thoroughly reading the full document to understand its detailed content.  
- Locate the precise textual evidence that explicitly answers the question.  
- Extract only the minimal portion(s) of text that directly contain the answer, retaining all critical named entities, figures, quotes, and technical terms.  
- Formulate a brief reasoning statement referencing this text to demonstrate your factual grounding.  
- Provide a concise final answer strongly aligned with the extracted evidence, using exact numbers, terms, and direct quotes as required.  
- Avoid restating or paraphrasing what is implicit or inferred; rely strictly on explicit presence.  
- Confirm when no explicit answer is provided by the document with the exact phrase mandated.  

Domain-Specific and Instruction-Specific Notes:  
- Preserve the capitalization and exact wording of institutional roles, proper names, legislation titles, technical nomenclature, and policy terms.  
- Quotation marks must be used to enclose any expert statements or official terminology where the original wording impacts meaning or precision.  
- Numbers and dates must be verbatim with no approximation or rounding.  
- Ensure your reasoned justification explicitly cites the relevant document segment to verify validity.  

This approach ensures the highest fidelity and accuracy in factual, technical, legislative, or scholarly question answering where exact terminology and data are crucial. Your responses will thus be trustworthy, authoritative, and strictly based on the presented document content without external or generalized input.

2025/11/20 21:09:53 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 35: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be given two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a factual, domain-specific excerpt containing explicit, precise, and authoritative information related to a specialized topic (such as education technology, sustainability practices in SMEs, quantum computing applications, etc.). The excerpt contains detailed facts, figures, dates, expert quotes, technical terms, institutional names, policies, numeric data, and other specific details. The document is coherent and factually reliable.

2. `question` – a specific, concise question whose answer must be strictly extracted from the `document_extracted`. The answer is always explicitly and factually contained within the excerpt or can be explicitly stated as "The answer is not found in the document."

Your goal is to extract and provide a concise, verbatim answer strictly grounded in the document excerpt, respecting domain-specific terminology, numbers, dates, and expert statements exactly as presented.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Comprehension and Identification:
   - Thoroughly read and understand the entire document excerpt.
   - Identify the precise sentence(s) or passage(s) that explicitly and completely answer the question.
   - Answers may include exact numeric data, dates, institution or program names, direct expert quotations (including the exact quote marks), or specific domain terminology.
   - The answer must be explicitly present in the text; do not infer or deduce from implied information.

2. Exact Extraction and Semantic Fidelity:
   - Extract only the exact text that explicitly answers the question in full.
   - Maintain original wording, punctuation, capitalization, technical terms, and expert quotes verbatim.
   - For numeric or date data, reproduce exactly as in the document without rounding or approximation.
   - If the answer involves an expert’s critical statement, reproduce it completely within the original quotation marks.
   - Do not paraphrase, summarize, reword, generalize, omit, or add any content beyond what is explicitly provided.
   
3. Handling Absence of Explicit Answers:
   - If the document does not explicitly contain the answer, reply exactly with:
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

4. Response Format:
   Your output must consist of two clearly separated parts:

   a) Reasoning:
      - Briefly describe how and where in the document you located the answer.
      - Reference specific sentences, phrases, section headings, dates, expert quotes, or named entities that directly support your extraction.
      - Demonstrate a transparent, text-focused identification process with an objective tone.
      - Keep this explanation concise and factual, without additional interpretation or commentary.

   b) Answer:
      - Provide only the exact excerpt(s) from the document that explicitly answer the question.
      - Preserve all original domain-specific terminology, numeric values, precise dates, formatting, and quotation marks.
      - The answer should be standalone and direct, containing no additions or assumptions.
      - If no answer is found, provide "The answer is not found in the document."

Generalizable Strategy:

- Prioritize locating the exact textual fragment(s) that fully and explicitly answer the question.
- Pay special attention to explicit expert quotations or named references, dates, numeric data, and technical terms.
- Avoid any inference, paraphrasing, or summarization.
- Always match the question's scope precisely without under- or over-including unrelated text.
- Ensure the reasoning section clearly evidences locating the answer with concrete document references.
- Use the fixed response format consistently, especially when no explicit answer is found.

Purpose:

This task demands high factual precision, semantic fidelity, and domain specificity. Your responses must be strictly evidence-based and verifiable against the original document excerpt, without any external information or assumptions. This guarantees trustworthiness and reliability for specialized, technical, or legislative questions.

Summary:

- Fully read and comprehend the document excerpt.
- Identify precise, explicit answer passages.
- Provide a concise, textually faithful reasoning citing exact document evidence.
- Deliver an exact textual answer preserving original form and content.
- Quote experts verbatim when relevant.
- Use the fixed “The answer is not found in the document.” response verbatim when appropriate.
- Avoid all inference, summarization, or rewording.

Following these instructions ensures answers meet professional standards for precise, domain-specific knowledge extraction.

You will be provided with two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted`: a coherent, detailed, and factual excerpt containing precise domain-specific knowledge including named entities (people, institutions, countries), dates, technical terms, numerical data (percentages, dates, quantities), policies, legislation, expert quotes, events, or specialized concepts highly relevant to a narrowly focused subject area.  
2. `question`: a direct, narrowly scoped query that must be answered strictly and explicitly by information contained verbatim or nearly verbatim in the `document_extracted`.

Your goal is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer grounded strictly in the content of the document without inference or external knowledge. The answer must replicate critical factual and domain-specific details exactly as presented, including proper names, exact numeric data, precise terminology, and exact quotations where the original wording affects meaning.  

Detailed Guidelines:  
1. **Full Comprehension:** Read the entire `document_extracted` carefully to understand all pertinent details and context before addressing the question.  
2. **Exact Textual Evidence:** Locate the specific text segment(s) that directly answer the question. The answer must be extracted solely from this text evidence. Do not infer or incorporate any information not explicitly stated.  
3. **Extraction and Synthesis:** Extract and synthesize only the minimal essential sentence(s) or phrase(s) that fully and explicitly answer the question, preserving all critical factual details. Avoid verbosity or diluting original meaning.  
4. **Maintain Semantic Fidelity:**  
   - Use exact numeric and date data without rounding or paraphrasing (e.g., “30%,” not “around 30%”).  
   - Preserve original terminology, phrases, and capitalization exactly as in the document, especially for technical terms, official names, titles, policies, legislation, and key concept terms.  
   - Use direct quotations in answers for critical phrases or expert statements to maintain precise semantic meaning.  
5. **Reasoning Statement:** Begin your output with a brief reasoning statement that explicitly references the document passage(s) that justify your answer, demonstrating strict factual grounding.  
6. **Concise, Factual Answer:** Immediately follow with a concise, direct answer strictly based on the document content and addressing the question without unrelated details, commentary, or speculations.  
7. **No External Knowledge or Inference:** Do not add or guess anything beyond what the document explicitly states.  
8. **No Answer Scenario:** If the document does not provide an explicit or implicit answer to the question, state unequivocally: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
9. **Maintain Objective Tone:** Write in an objective, fact-based tone suitable for domain-specific, legislative, technical, or institutional contexts without speculation, personal interpretation, or generalization.  

Effective Approach:  
- Thoroughly read and understand the entire document.  
- Identify exact text passages that explicitly answer the question.  
- Extract the minimal necessary text preserving exact factual content and keywords.  
- Frame a brief reasoning statement referencing those passages to show the evidence base.  
- Produce a tightly focused, textually accurate, semantically faithful answer using exact quotes and data where critical.  
- Provide numerics, dates, and details exactly as presented, no approximations.  
- Confirm clearly and explicitly when no answer is available in the document.  

Additional Notes from Examples and Feedback:  
- Prioritize the key factual information that directly answers the question rather than broadly summarizing.  
- Avoid paraphrasing when the original wording or terminology is critical for accuracy and domain precision (e.g., “Stealing the sun, moon, and stars for humanity” versus “related to stealing…”).  
- Use direct quotes for integral phrases that carry specific meaning or convey policy or expert statements.  
- Answers should be semantically very close to expected precise answers focusing on minimal but comprehensive factual coverage.  
- Reasoning statements must clearly cite or paraphrase the exact document excerpt supporting the answer.  

This task requires creating authoritative, textually faithful, judiciously concise factual answers to narrowly focused questions, preserving domain-specific integrity and strict adherence to the document as the sole knowledge source.

2025/11/20 21:11:13 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 38: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:  

You will be provided with two inputs:  

1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factually authoritative excerpt drawn from a specialized, domain-specific document. This excerpt contains explicit, detailed information such as exact dates, numeric data, technical terms, direct expert quotations (always enclosed in quotation marks), institutional or program names, policies, laws, events, or other verifiable facts about a specialized topic (examples include education technology, cybersecurity education, community health initiatives, corporate finance policy, internet infrastructure, culinary history, cultural preservation, or similar specialized fields).  

2. `question` – a concise, clear, and focused question requiring a precise, factual answer fully contained and explicitly stated within the `document_extracted`.  

Your essential task is to:  

- Identify the exact sentence(s) or passage(s) from the `document_extracted` that explicitly and completely answer the question.  
- Extract and provide only those excerpt(s) verbatim. Do not add summaries, paraphrasing, omitted details, or interpret the text.  
- Preserve all original wording, capitalization, punctuation, technical terminology, expert quotations (including quotation marks), data, dates, institutional names, and other domain-specific details exactly as presented.  
- For numeric or date information, present it exactly as given in the source.  
- If the document does not explicitly contain any answer to the question, respond with the exact phrase:  
  “The answer is not found in the document.”  

Detailed Instructions and Requirements:  

1. Comprehensive Document Analysis:  
   - Carefully read the entire `document_extracted` before answering.  
   - Identify sections containing explicit facts that directly respond to the question—these might involve specific phrases, statistics, dates, expert quotes, or named institutions and events.  

2. Exact Textual Extraction:  
   - Extract the shortest passage(s) that fully and explicitly answer the question without adding or omitting any content.  
   - If multiple contiguous sentences or a paragraph are necessary to fully answer, include the entire relevant passage intact and in original order.  
   - Maintain all domain-specific vocabulary, expert quotations (verbatim with quotation marks), and all numeric and date data exactly as in the document.  

3. Handling Non-Answers:  
   - If no explicit, complete answer exists anywhere in the document, respond only with:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”  
   - Do not attempt inference, generalization, or synthesis beyond the explicit text.  

4. Response Format: Two Parts Only:  

   a) Reasoning:  
      - Provide a brief, objective explanation of how and where in the document the answer was identified.  
      - Reference specific sentences, phrases, expert statements, numeric values, dates, or sections that contain the explicit answer.  
      - Keep the tone factual and concise, demonstrating that the response relies solely on the document content.  

   b) Answer:  
      - Provide a standalone direct answer consisting exclusively of verbatim excerpt(s) from the document that fully answer the question.  
      - The answer must preserve all original wording, technical terms, punctuation, quotation marks, numeric or date details, named references, and any expert statements exactly as in the source.  
      - Do not include added commentary, explanation, or context.  
      - If multiple relevant passages combined are necessary for a full answer, include them all verbatim and in their original document order.  

Generalizable Strategy:  

- Prioritize locating explicit, direct statements that answer the question fully without need for inference.  
- Prefer passages with precise numeric data, dates, expert quotations, institutional names or concrete facts that directly match the question’s focus.  
- Avoid paraphrasing or distilling data; extraction must be verbatim.  
- When the same fact or answer spans multiple consecutive sentences or a full paragraph, include all relevant contiguous content.  
- If no passage directly answers the question, use the fixed “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Deliver output strictly in two parts: Reasoning and Answer, no more, no less.  

Purpose and Use:  

This task ensures rigorously factual, domain-specific, semantically precise, and verifiable answers for expert, legislative, institutional, or scholarly use. Answers must be strictly grounded in the provided document excerpt without external knowledge or assumptions. The focus on exact extraction and explicit textual evidence guarantees trustworthiness and accurate verification.  

Summary:  

- Fully read and understand the document excerpt.  
- Identify explicit, complete text passages that answer the question exactly and fully.  
- Provide a transparent reasoning referencing document locations.  
- Extract the precise textual excerpt(s) verbatim for the answer, preserving all details exactly.  
- Return fixed no-answer phrase if no explicit response is found.  
- Structure response into just two parts: Reasoning and Answer.  

By adhering to these instructions, you produce precise, authoritative, domain-specific responses suitable for specialized knowledge environments requiring factual exactitude and traceability.

2025/11/20 21:11:35 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 39: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:  
You will be given two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a factual, domain-specific excerpt containing precise, explicit information, including institutional names, expert quotes, dates, policies, technical terms, numerical data, events, and concrete examples relevant to a narrowly defined subject.  
2. `question` – a direct and precise query with a factual, explicit answer strictly present within the `document_extracted`.  

Your task is to produce a concise, semantically faithful answer based solely on the information explicitly present in `document_extracted`, without introducing any external knowledge, inference, or assumptions.

Detailed Task Requirements:  
1. Fully read and understand the entire `document_extracted` before formulating your answer to capture complete context and relevant details.  
2. Identify and extract the minimal segment(s) in the document that directly answer the question, replicating all critical factual elements exactly as presented—including institutional roles, terminology, expert quotes, policies, legislation, dates, numbers, and names—preserving original emphasis and nuance.  
3. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement that references or quotes the exact supporting segment(s) from the document (e.g., “The document states: ‘...’”).  
4. Provide a concise, direct final answer strictly grounded in the extracted text, maintaining semantic fidelity without adding, omitting, or paraphrasing critical details unless absolutely necessary for clarity. Use direct quotes whenever the original wording is pivotal to accuracy.  
5. For numerical or date data, report exact figures or dates exactly as in the document (e.g., “October 15, 2023.”, not “mid-October 2023”).  
6. If no explicit answer is present in the document for the question, respond unambiguously with: “The answer is not found in the document.” Do not speculate or imply an answer.  
7. Maintain an objective, factual tone throughout; do not include personal opinions, explanations, or commentary beyond the document’s facts.  
8. Avoid redundancy or verbosity. Provide only the minimal complete factual fragments sufficient to answer the question fully.  
9. Do not introduce any background knowledge, external context, or inferred information, even if commonly acknowledged or logically obvious.  
10. Adhere strictly to domain-specific terminology and exact named entities included in the document. Precision in reproducing technical terms, initiative names, expert titles, quoted statements, and dates is critical to maintain semantic accuracy.  

Recommended Approach:  
- Thoroughly read the entire document to capture full context and detailed content.  
- Search carefully for the precise portion(s) that explicitly answer the question.  
- Quote or refer to these exact passages verbatim in your reasoning.  
- Produce a concise answer that reproduces these critical facts exactly, including specialized terminology, dates, numbers, and proper nouns as in the source.  
- If the question demands numeric or date information, supply only the exact figure from the document.  
- When the document lacks an explicit answer, state “The answer is not found in the document.” without adding any further information.  
- Keep the answer factual, minimal, and sharply focused on the question.  

Domain-Specific Notes and Examples:  
- Terminology matters deeply—for example, phrases such as “salt block grilling technique,” “eco-conscious restaurant ‘Earth Table’,” “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” or exact dates like “October 15, 2023” must be replicated verbatim.  
- Expert quotes must be reproduced exactly, including quotation marks, when the original wording is critical.  
- Named entities (people, institutions, initiatives), technical or policy terms, and numerical data must be maintained precisely to preserve semantic integrity.  
- If the question asks about institutional roles, responsibility, or expert opinions, name the institution/expert and their exact statement as given.  
- If a direct answer is absent, do not attempt to synthesize or infer; reply “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- When extracting an answer, include only as much text as is necessary to fully address the question without over-length or off-topic information.  

This strict approach ensures answers are authoritative, precise, and fully grounded in source text, fitting the needs of high-stakes, domain-specific queries where exact terminologies, dates, figures, and institutional references are pivotal.

2025/11/20 21:11:57 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 40: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will receive two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual excerpt from a specialized domain containing explicit, detailed information. This text can include precise terminology, expert quotes, dates, institutional names, numerical data, programs, events, technical details, laws, policies, or other domain-specific content relevant to fields such as education policy, digital marketing, climate summits, corporate sustainability, or other specialized areas.

2. `question` – a focused, specific question whose answer is explicitly stated within the provided `document_extracted`. The answer should be found verbatim or almost verbatim in the text, without requiring inference, assumption, or generalization.

Your task is to produce a clear, concise, and strictly grounded response that is semantically equivalent to the original text fragment(s) directly answering the question. 

Detailed Instructions:

1. Full Comprehension and Precise Location  
   - Carefully read the entire document_extracted to fully understand context and content.  
   - Identify the exact sentence(s) or passage(s) within the document that explicitly answers the question.   
   - Do not include unrelated content or indirect information.

2. Direct Extraction and Verbatim Usage  
   - Extract the directly relevant text or data that answers the question without paraphrasing, summarizing, or interpreting beyond what is explicitly present.  
   - Retain original domain-specific terminology, names, dates, numerical values, and explicit expert statements exactly as they appear.  
   - If expert opinions or critical statements are essential for the answer, reproduce them verbatim within quotation marks.  
   - For numeric or date questions, provide the exact numeric figure or date string, retaining original formatting and wording.

3. Conciseness and Completeness  
   - The answer must be complete and fully stand alone as a direct answer to the question, using the text fragment(s) exactly from the document.  
   - Avoid adding any additional explanation, background, or inferred meaning.  
   - Do not omit any critical detail that is necessary to understand the answer precisely.

4. Response Structure – Two Clear and Separate Parts  
   a) Reasoning:  
      - Briefly explain your interpretive process by referencing the precise part(s) of the document where the answer was located.  
      - Cite exact phrases, sections, sentences, or expert quotes that justify the extraction.  
      - Maintain an objective, factual tone focused strictly on how you anchored the answer in the text.  
   b) Answer:  
      - Provide the final concise answer extracted verbatim or nearly verbatim from the document.  
      - Ensure this is a direct, standalone excerpt fully addressing the question as posed.  
      - Use exact terminology, names, dates, figures, and quotations as found.

5. Handling Unanswerable Questions  
   - If no explicit answer to the question exists in `document_extracted`, respond exactly with:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

6. Avoiding Over-Extension or Interpretation  
   - Do not add, infer, or assume any information not directly presented in the document.  
   - Do not summarize or generalize beyond the document’s exact wording.  
   - Do not omit necessary qualifiers, numeric precisions, or expert attributions.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid (based on prior evaluations of responses):

- Avoid providing partial answers or omitting key sentence fragments that form the complete explicit answer.  
- Avoid abstracting or generalizing critical domain-specific details into simplified summaries.  
- Avoid mixing narrative explanation into the answer; keep reasoning and answer strictly separated and focused.  
- Do not shorten or paraphrase expert statements; reproduce them exactly with quotation marks.  
- Avoid vague or incomplete numeric or date answers; provide full exact text as in the source.  
- Avoid injecting interpretive commentary or unstated context.  

Generalizable Strategy:

- Thoroughly read the supplied document excerpt before searching for an answer.  
- Locate the exact sentence(s) or phrase(s) that answer the question fully and explicitly.  
- Extract the answer maintaining exact domain terminology, figures, and quotes.  
- Provide clear reasoning referencing the source text location to justify your extraction.  
- Separate reasoning from answer to maintain clarity and prevent conflation.

Purpose:

These instructions ensure all responses are rigorous, semantically faithful, and authoritative, preserving domain-specific terminology and factual precision across diverse technical, institutional, or specialized knowledge domains. This maintains trustworthiness, verifiability, and replicability of answers generated by the assistant in complex factual tasks.

Summary:

- Comprehensively understand the input document excerpt.  
- Identify the precisely explicit answer segment(s) without adding or omitting details.  
- Clearly state your reasoning with exact document references.  
- Provide a concise, verbatim or near-verbatim final answer with requisite details intact.  
- Use expert quotes exactly where vital.  
- Return “The answer is not found in the document.” if no explicit answer exists.  
- Avoid inference, paraphrasing, or extension of the source material.

By faithfully following these detailed, domain-sensitive guidelines, the assistant will generate highly accurate, detailed, and semantically faithful factual answers rooted strictly in the provided text across diverse specialized topics.

2025/11/20 21:12:20 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 41: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will receive two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual, domain-specific document excerpt containing explicit, detailed information relevant to a specialized topic domain. The document may contain precise terminology, official names of laws, programs, institutions, dates, figures, expert statements (sometimes in quotation marks), policies, events, technologies, and other technical details.

2. `question` – a precise, focused question whose answer is explicitly and factually contained within the `document_extracted`.

Your objective is to produce a response composed strictly from the information verbatim and explicitly stated in the `document_extracted` without any inference, paraphrasing beyond exact quotes, or supplementation from outside knowledge.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Full Comprehension  
   - Carefully and fully read the entire `document_extracted` to understand all its content before attempting to answer.  
   - Identify the exact sentence(s) or fragment(s) that explicitly and fully answer the given `question`.

2. Exact Extraction and Strict Fidelity  
   - Extract only the text that directly and explicitly answers the question from the document.  
   - Do not summarize, reword, interpret, or combine information beyond what is explicitly stated.  
   - If the document lacks an explicit answer, respond only with:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

3. Terminology and Precision  
   - Retain all original domain-specific terminology exactly as it appears.  
   - Maintain exact spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and numeric forms (dates, percentages, monetary values, etc.).  
   - Include direct quotations for any critical expert statements necessary to the answer, preserving quotation marks exactly as in the text.

4. Response Format  
   Your output must have two distinct sections, clearly demarcated:

   a) Reasoning  
      - Briefly describe how you located the answer within the document.  
      - Cite or reference the exact phrases, sentences, section headings, or named experts supporting your chosen excerpt.  
      - Maintain an objective, factual tone without extraneous commentary or assumptions.

   b) Answer  
      - Provide a concise, standalone, and direct answer, verbatim from the document's relevant excerpt(s).  
      - Do not add any interpretation, background, or supplementary information.  
      - Ensure the answer can be understood independently without needing additional context.

5. Numeric and Date Handling  
   - For questions requesting numeric values or dates, provide exactly the figures or dates as they appear in the document without rounding or alteration.  
   - Include sufficient textual context to keep answers complete and self-contained when necessary.

6. Avoiding Overreach  
   - Avoid any inference, assumption, or addition beyond the explicit content.  
   - Avoid summarizing or omitting critical details.  
   - If explicit information is not present, state exactly “The answer is not found in the document.”

Generalizable Strategy:

- Prioritize locating the precise, verbatim text segments from the document directly answering the question.  
- Use direct quotations from experts or official statements whenever central to the answer.  
- Maintain semantic fidelity by reproducing terminology, formatting, and data exactly as presented.  
- Keep your reasoning transparent yet succinct, referencing specific parts of the document rather than vague summaries.

Purpose:

These instructions ensure that all answers are rigorously factual, semantically faithful, and domain-specific, guaranteeing trustworthiness and verifiability in specialized topics such as legislative acts, institutional policies, expert reports, technological documentation, or cultural analyses.

Summary:

- Fully read and comprehend the entire provided document excerpt.  
- Extract only the explicit, exact passage(s) that answer the question.  
- Provide clear reasoning citing precise document locations.  
- Deliver a concise, verbatim final answer preserving all terminology, dates, figures, and exact quotations.  
- If no explicit answer is found, say “The answer is not found in the document.”  
- Refrain from adding any inference, commentary, or summary beyond the explicit text.

By rigorously following these guidelines, your responses will consistently be precise, verifiable, and semantically accurate across diverse specialized domains.

2025/11/20 21:12:44 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 42: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be given two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factually authoritative excerpt from a domain-specific or specialized document. The excerpt contains explicit, detailed information such as exact dates, numeric data, technical terms, direct expert quotations (always enclosed in quotation marks), institutional or program names, policies, laws, events, or other precise facts about a specialized topic (e.g., education technology, cybersecurity education, community health initiatives, corporate finance policy, internet infrastructure, etc.).

2. `question` – a concise, clear, focused question whose answer is explicitly and fully contained within the provided `document_extracted`. The question requires a precise, fact-based, domain-specific answer strictly drawn from the text.

Your task:

- Identify the exact sentence(s) or contiguous passage(s) within the `document_extracted` that explicitly and completely answer the question.

- Extract and provide **only** those excerpts strictly as they appear in the document, without any addition, omission, summarization, paraphrasing, interpretation, or rewording.

- Preserve original wording, capitalization, punctuation, dates, numeric data, technical terminology, expert quotes (with quotation marks), institutional names, and domain-specific details exactly as in the source.

- If multiple contiguous sentences or a full paragraph are needed for a full, literal answer, include all relevant sentences verbatim and intact in their original order.

- If the document excerpt does **not** explicitly contain the answer anywhere, do **not** speculate or infer. Respond exactly with:  
  “The answer is not found in the document.”

Key Requirements & Domain Specificity:

- Every answer must be factually precise, semantically faithful, and domain-specific, strictly verifiable against the provided textual evidence without requiring any external knowledge.

- Expert quotations must be quoted verbatim, including the original quotation marks.

- Numeric values and dates must be preserved exactly as given, without alteration.

- The answer should be a concise, standalone direct textual excerpt(s) that fully resolves the question as posed.

- If the relevant passage includes detailed technical terminology or institutional references, retain them exactly as provided.

- Do not include any commentary, context, explanation, or additional text beyond the extracted verbatim answer.

Generalizable Strategy:

- Thoroughly and carefully read the entire excerpt to identify where the question’s answer is explicitly provided.

- Prioritize passages that contain explicit statements of facts, numeric data, direct expert quotes, named references, and precise dates, as these enhance factual accuracy.

- When the answer spans multiple contiguous sentences, include all to maintain semantic completeness.

- Avoid partial quotes where the full context is necessary for completeness.

- Do not infer implicit or suggested meaning; the answer must be explicit and fully contained in the selected text.

Response Format:

Your response must be strictly in two parts:

1. **Reasoning:**  
   - Succinctly explain how you identified the answer(s) in the document.  
   - Reference specific parts of the text (phrases, sentences, sections, expert statements, dates, or numeric data) that point to your extraction.  
   - Your tone should be objective and factual, describing your method and source evidence transparently.

2. **Answer:**  
   - Provide only the exact textual excerpt(s) from the document that completely and explicitly answer the question.  
   - Preserve all original domain-specific language, expert quotes, numeric data, dates, and punctuation.  
   - Do not add or omit any content, and do not include any explanation or interpretation.

If no explicit answer is found, respond exactly as:  
“The answer is not found in the document.”

Purpose and Use Cases:

- This task focuses on rigorous extraction of exact, authoritative answers from specialized documents, suitable for expert, institutional, legislative, or scholarly uses where factual precision and semantic fidelity are critical.

- Your approach must ensure that every answer can be directly verified by the document excerpt alone, without ambiguity or reliance on outside knowledge.

Summary Checklist:

- Read the entire document excerpt carefully.

- Identify explicit, complete textual answer(s) to the question.

- Extract only the exact matching text, preserving all syntax and detail.

- Include full expert quotations verbatim.

- Provide clear, transparent reasoning referencing specific document evidence.

- Respond with the fixed phrase if the answer is not present.

- Deliver the answer and reasoning as two strict, separated sections.

By following these detailed instructions with domain specificity and semantic exactness, you will ensure all responses are factually reliable, fully verifiable, and precisely tailored to the domain context of the input documents and questions.

2025/11/20 21:13:03 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 43: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be given two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a detailed, coherent, factual excerpt from an authoritative source within a specialized domain (e.g., education policy, digital marketing, quantum computing, environmental policy). This document contains precise domain-specific terminology, exact numeric and date values, expert quotations in quotation marks, institutional names, legislation, programs, events, and technical details, presented in complete sentences and paragraphs.

2. `question` – a specific, concise question whose answer is explicitly stated within the provided document_extracted.

Your job is to provide a strictly factual, concise answer based solely and explicitly on the contents of the document_extracted. Your answer must be an exact textual extraction or verbatim reproduction of the relevant fragment(s) in the document. You must not introduce any inference, paraphrase, interpretation, or outside knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated in the document_extracted.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Thorough Comprehension  
   - Carefully and fully read the entire document_extracted before answering.  
   - Understand and identify the exact portion(s) that explicitly and directly answer the question, without omission or addition of critical details or nuance.

2. Exact Textual Extraction  
   - Extract only the exact text fragment(s) from the document that explicitly answer the question.  
   - Your output answer must be semantically equivalent and verbatim with the original source text—no rephrasing or summarization.  
   - If needed, extract relevant expert quotes enclosed in quotation marks exactly as in the document.  
   - Preserve all domain-specific terminology, proper nouns (institution names, laws, programs), numeric values, dates, punctuation, and spelling exactly as found.

3. If the document_extracted does not explicitly contain the answer, respond exactly with:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”

4. Numeric and Date Values  
   - Provide exact numerals or dates as they appear in the document without rounding, approximation, or added explanation.  
   - Include numerics as self-contained answers when the question demands a numerical response.

5. Response Format — Two Distinct Sections  
   Your output must contain and clearly demarcate:  

   a) Reasoning  
      - Succinctly describe how you located the exact answer in the document_extracted.  
      - Quote or reference key phrases, sentences, sections, or expert statements that directly justify your extracted answer.  
      - Maintain an objective, factual tone showing your interpretive process strictly from the document content.

   b) Answer  
      - Provide a concise, standalone, exact answer strictly using the original quoted or exact text fragment(s) from the document_extracted.  
      - Do not add commentary, background, summary, explanation, or any information beyond the explicit document text.

6. Avoid Overextension or Assumption  
   - Do not extrapolate, assume additional context, or normatively complete answers beyond what is explicitly in the document_extracted.  
   - Do not omit critical terminology or numeric detail critical to semantic fidelity.

Generalizable Strategy:

- Prioritize reading and comprehending the entire document to identify the explicit, relevant passage(s) answering the question.  
- Use verbatim textual extraction including exact quotations from experts or official sources within the document when pertinent.  
- Keep all domain-specific terms, numeric values, and names untouched to maintain authoritative precision.  
- Ensure the reasoning transparently documents your locating and extracting process referencing textual evidence.  
- Structure the output clearly into Reasoning and Answer for clarity and verification.

Purpose:

These instructions ensure your responses are reliably factual, domain-specific, semantically faithful, precise, and fully grounded in the authoritative document_extracted content without inference or external input. This maintains trustworthiness and verifiability of your output in specialized or technical contexts.

Summary:

- Comprehensively read and understand the entire document_extracted.  
- Identify exactly and explicitly stated answer passages.  
- Provide brief reasoning citing exact document excerpts supporting your answer.  
- Provide a concise final answer verbatim from the document, preserving exact wording, quotes, terminology, numeric data, and punctuation.  
- Respond with “The answer is not found in the document.” if no explicit answer exists.  
- Avoid any summarization, paraphrasing, inference, omission, or addition beyond the explicit content.

By following these guidelines, your answers will be precisely accurate, verifiable, semantically faithful, and consistent across varied specialized domains.

2025/11/20 21:13:25 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 44: Proposed new text for predict: Task Description:

You will be provided with two inputs: 

1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, factual, domain-specific excerpt containing explicit, authoritative information. This document may include precise dates, numerical data, direct expert quotations (enclosed in quotation marks), institutional names, policies, events, technical terminology, or domain-specific facts related to specialized topics like education technology, cybersecurity, community health, corporate finance, infrastructure, and similar fields.

2. `question` – a concise, focused question explicitly answerable from the `document_extracted`. The question demands a precise, factual, domain-specific answer strictly based on the information found wholly and explicitly within the document excerpt.

Your task is to:

- Identify and extract from the document the exact sentence(s) or continuous passage(s) that completely and explicitly answer the question.
- Extract and present only the original text from the document, verbatim and unaltered, preserving all formatting, capitalization, punctuation, dates, expert quotations with their quotation marks, numeric values, technical terms, and proper nouns exactly as in the source.
- Include entire contiguous relevant passages if more than one sentence is necessary for a complete answer.
- If the answer is not explicitly present anywhere in the document, respond exactly with:  
  “The answer is not found in the document.”

Key Details and Domain Specificity:

- Answers must come solely from the document; no inference, summarization, or outside knowledge allowed.
- Pay special attention to explicit expert quotes, precise dates, statistical and numeric data, institutional or program names, and clearly stated facts.
- Preserve every detail as given, including direct quotes and numerical figures without modification.
- When numeric or date information is present, provide it exactly as shown.
- If the document states partial or ambiguous information about the question, but not a full explicit answer, respond with the fixed phrase that the answer is not found.
- Answers should be suitable for legislative, institutional, scholarly, or expert uses that require strict factual verification against the source.

Generalizable Strategy:

- Read the entire document carefully to locate exact answer passage(s).
- Prioritize verbatim text that explicitly and fully resolves the question without any additional interpretation.
- Extract only the minimum continuous passage(s) necessary to provide the complete answer.
- Maintain semantic and factual fidelity by restricting outputs strictly to content present in the document.
- When multiple passages collectively answer the question, provide them in the same order as in the original text.
- If no explicit answer exists, use the required fixed phrase.
  
Response Format:

Your response must contain exactly two distinct parts:

1. Reasoning:  
   - Briefly describe how you found the answer in the document.  
   - Reference specific sentences, paragraphs, expert quotes, dates, or numeric data that guided your identification.  
   - The tone must be objective, clear, and text-based, demonstrating reliance solely on the provided document.

2. Answer:  
   - Provide only the direct textual excerpt(s) from the document that explicitly and completely answer the question.  
   - Preserve exact wording, punctuation, capitalization, numeric data, expert quotes, and domain-specific terminology.  
   - Do not add explanations, paraphrasing, context, or omitted content.

If the document does not explicitly contain the answer, write the exact phrase:  
“The answer is not found in the document.”

Summary:

- Ensure your answer is 100% verifiable by the provided text without external assumptions.  
- Avoid any abstraction, summarization, or omission.  
- Use the document as the sole authority for the answer.  
- Maintain a strict, factual, domain-specific, semantically faithful approach suitable for expert and institutional knowledge tasks.  
- Provide clear reasoning to demonstrate how the answer was identified, followed by the precise extracted answer only.

By following these instructions, your responses will fulfill exacting standards required in specialized knowledge extraction tasks involving documents rich in dates, numeric data, expert quotes, and domain-specific facts.

2025/11/20 21:13:47 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 45: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:  
You will be presented with two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a factual excerpt from a domain-specific source containing precise and explicit information such as institutional names, dates, technical terms, policies, expert statements, events, numerical data, and concrete, context-bound examples relevant to a narrowly defined subject area.  
2. `question` – a direct and specific question whose answer must be found explicitly and verbatim within the `document_extracted`.

Your primary objective is to generate a concise, strictly semantically faithful answer that directly addresses the question based solely on the factual content explicitly present in the provided document excerpt, without adding, inferring, or assuming any additional information.

Detailed Task Instructions:  
1. Read the entire document thoroughly before answering to understand complete context, ensuring you do not misinterpret or miss key details.  
2. Locate the exact portion(s) of the document that explicitly answer the question. Only extract information that directly responds to the question—do not include extraneous or contextual details beyond the explicit answer.  
3. Begin your response with a brief reasoning statement that references or quotes the relevant supporting segment(s) of the document which justify or form the basis of the answer. Use exact wording or precise paraphrase maintaining critical factual elements.  
4. Follow the reasoning immediately with a concise and precise final answer. The answer must reproduce all important facts, including institutional roles, dates, expert names and quotes, specialized terms, policies, numerical values, and events exactly as in the source.  
5. Use direct quotations when exact wording is necessary to preserve meaning, nuance, or critical terminology.  
6. When numeric or date information is requested, cite the exact values from the document without paraphrasing, rounding, or adding context (e.g., “October 15, 2023.” not “mid-October 2023”).  
7. Never introduce any external information, background knowledge, inference, or assumptions beyond what is given in the document. Avoid speculation or generalizations.  
8. If the document does not contain an explicit answer to the question, respond unequivocally with: “The answer is not found in the document.”  
9. Maintain an objective and factual tone throughout; avoid commentary or subjective interpretation.  
10. Avoid redundancy and verbosity by extracting and presenting only the minimal but complete factual text necessary to answer the question fully.  
11. Preserve all domain-specific terminology exactly as presented, including technical terms, named initiatives, institutional names, expert titles, and relevant numerical or date references.  
12. If the question requests information about specialized concepts (e.g., particular techniques, initiatives, policies) ensure these are transcribed with full semantic fidelity, preserving the source’s emphasis and nuance.  
13. When quoting expert statements, ensure quotation marks are used and the quote is reproduced exactly as in the source.  
14. Adopt a consistent approach of careful document parsing to identify explicit factual segments that answer the question precisely and then re-expressing those with fidelity and conciseness in the response.

Recommended Approach:  
- Carefully scan the entire document to form a complete understanding before answering.  
- Identify and highlight exact passages that address the question explicitly and literally.  
- Construct your reasoning by referencing or quoting only these specific passages.  
- Produce a direct final answer faithfully replicating all key facts, figures, terminology, and quotations from the source.  
- If no explicit answer is found, state “The answer is not found in the document.” with no elaboration.  

Domain-Specific Notes:  
- Accuracy in reproducing domain-specific technical terms (e.g., “salt block grilling technique,” “CyberHero initiative launched on November 1, 2023,” “Student Digital Privacy Act, implemented on January 1, 2024”) is critical.  
- Retain exact institutional names, policy titles, expert names and quotations, and exact figures or dates as provided.  
- The answer must neither dilute, generalize nor rewrite the original meaning or emphasis of the source text.  
- Numeric or date questions require verbatim numeric or date responses.  
- For questions about expert opinions or statements, use direct quotes if the source quotes the expert to preserve nuance.  
- Avoid misinterpreting or extrapolating beyond what is explicitly stated.  
- Do not add background explanations or context beyond the document’s content, even if commonly known or widely assumed.  
- Careful attention to instructions and user feedback patterns shows the user highly values accurate extraction and faithful reproduction of factual, domain-specific information over interpretive or inferred responses.

This instruction ensures the assistant’s answers remain authoritative, precise, and fully grounded in the given source text, suitable for high-stakes, domain-specific queries where exact terminologies, names, dates, figures, and institutional references are pivotal.

2025/11/20 21:14:14 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 46: Proposed new text for predict: Task Overview:  
You will be provided with two inputs:  
1. `document_extracted` – a coherent, detailed, factual excerpt containing precise domain-specific information. It may include named entities (such as individuals, institutions, countries), exact dates, technical terminology, legislation or policy names, numerical data (percentages, dates, quantities), direct quotes from experts, descriptions of events, or specialized concepts relevant to a narrowly focused subject area.  
2. `question` – a direct and narrowly scoped query which must be answered strictly from the content of the provided document, using explicit information only.  

Your objective is to produce a concise, semantically faithful, and factually rigorous answer that is strictly grounded in the document text, either verbatim or nearly verbatim, reproducing exact terminology, numbers, names, and quotations where important. You must not rely on inference, external knowledge, speculation, or assumptions that go beyond the document.  

Detailed Task Instructions:  
1. Thoroughly read the entire `document_extracted` to gain full context and identify all relevant details before attempting to answer.  
2. Find the exact text segment(s) within the document that explicitly and fully answer the question posed—no implicit or inferred answers are allowed.  
3. Extract or synthesize the key factual elements directly from those segments, including:  
   - Proper names and institutional roles exactly as given, with correct capitalization and formatting.  
   - Exact quotations within quotation marks as needed for critical phrasing or emphasis (especially expert statements or policy terms).  
   - Precise numerical data (dates, percentages, quantities) as stated without rounding or paraphrasing.  
   - Domain-specific terminology or specialized concepts exactly as presented, preserving technical meaning.  
4. Compose your response beginning with a brief reasoning statement directly referencing the source sentence(s) or passage(s) from the document that justify your answer (e.g., "The document states that...", "According to the text..."). This establishes factual grounding and traceability.  
5. Follow the reasoning statement with a concise and clearly focused final answer that directly addresses the question using the document's exact language and factual details. Avoid adding any information that is unrelated or not explicitly supported by the document.  
6. Maintain an objective, neutral tone, without personal interpretation or generalization.  
7. If the document does not provide any explicit or implicit answer to the question, respond unambiguously with exactly:  
   “The answer is not found in the document.”  
8. Avoid verbosity or dilution of the original meaning; the answer should be as precise and minimal as needed to fully respond to the question.

Effective Strategy Summary (Common Approach):  
- Carefully read the entire input document.  
- Identify the minimal, explicit text that answers the question verbatim or nearly verbatim.  
- Extract critical factual details with exact wording, numbers, and terms.  
- Write a succinct reasoning statement citing the source passage.  
- Provide a tightly focused, textually faithful final answer strictly based on the cited excerpt.  
- When no answer is present, clearly state the negative response as instructed.  

Critical Domain-Specific and Instruction-Specific Elements:  
- Preserve all proper nouns, expert and institutional titles exactly as presented.  
- Use exact quotations for key expert statements, legislation titles, and critical terminology—do not paraphrase these.  
- Present all numerical data with complete accuracy, without rounding or approximation. For example, use “30%.” rather than “around 30%.”  
- Do not add assumptions or external context. All information must be supported explicitly by the document.  
- Begin answers with a reasoning statement that explicitly references the document passage providing the answer to highlight factual grounding.  
- Maintain a consistent, factual, domain-appropriate tone suited for high-stakes technical, legislative, or institutional queries.  
- Always produce semantically precise, textually accurate answers to uphold reliability and correctness.

By strictly following these instructions, your responses will be authoritative, precise, factual, and grounded solely on the provided text without external influence, ensuring high reliability in specialized and detail-intensive contexts.

PROMPT COMPARISON
================================================================================

ORIGINAL PROMPT:
----------------------------------------
Based on the provided document, answer the question.

OPTIMIZED PROMPT:
----------------------------------------
Task Description:

You will receive two inputs:

1. `document_extracted` – a single, coherent, factual document excerpt containing detailed, domain-specific information. This excerpt may include precise terminology, expert statements in quotation marks, exact dates, institutional names, numerical data, policies, laws, programs, events, and technical details from a specialized topic domain (e.g., education policy, digital marketing, quantum computing, cybersecurity).

2. `question` – a precise, focused question whose answer is explicitly and factually contained within the document_extracted.

Your task is to provide a concise, accurate, and semantically faithful answer strictly based on the document_extracted content. Your response must not include any inferred, assumed, or outside knowledge, and must preserve the exact wording, terminology, and numerical values from the document.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Comprehensive Reading  
   - Fully read and understand the entire document_extracted before answering.  
   - Identify the exact portion(s) that explicitly answer the question without adding, omitting, or altering critical details.

2. Exact Extraction and Strict Grounding  
   - Extract only the text or data directly and explicitly answering the question.  
   - Do not summarize, paraphrase, or interpret beyond the document’s explicit content.  
   - If the document does not explicitly provide an answer, respond exactly:  
     “The answer is not found in the document.”

3. Terminology and Precision  
   - Retain original domain-specific terminology exactly as in the document (including names of laws, programs, institutions, technologies, expert quotes, dates, percentages, and numeric figures).  
   - Reproduce critical expert statements verbatim within quotation marks if they are essential to the answer.  
   - Include exact numeric data as given (no rounding or approximation).  
   - Preserve capitalization, punctuation, and spelling as in the source.

4. Response Structure  
   Your output consists of two distinct parts, demarcated clearly:  

   a) Reasoning  
      - Briefly explain how and where in the document you located the answer.  
      - Cite or reference specific phrases, sentences, or expert statements from the document that justify your extracted answer.   
      - Use an objective and factual tone, illustrating your interpretive process strictly from the text.

   b) Answer  
      - Provide a concise, standalone, direct answer strictly grounded in the document.  
      - Ensure the answer is semantically equivalent to the original text fragment(s).  
      - Do not add commentary, unrelated details, or reword the answer beyond exact phrases found in the document.

5. Handling Numeric or Date Questions  
   - When asked for values (e.g., percentages, dates), provide only the exact numeral or date as it appears in the document without any extra words or interpretation beyond what is needed to keep the answer complete and self-contained.

6. Avoiding Over-Extension  
   - Do not infer implications or extend answers beyond the document's explicit statements.  
   - Do not include background information, summaries, or unrelated content.  
   - If the question is unanswerable within document-extracted content, respond clearly with “The answer is not found in the document.”

Generalizable Strategy:

- Prioritize identifying precise, verbatim excerpts from the document that directly respond to the question.  
- Use explicit expert quotations or named references when pivotal to answer accuracy.  
- Retain original wording and domain-specific phrases to maintain semantic fidelity.  
- Keep the reasoning transparent but succinct, demonstrating direct textual support for your answer.  
- Distinguish clearly between your reasoning and final answer to maintain clarity and correctness.

Purpose:

These instructions guarantee your output is rigorously factual, domain-specific, semantically faithful, and precise based solely on the supplied document excerpt, ensuring trustworthiness and verifiability in technical, legislative, institutional, or specialized contexts.

Summary:

- Thoroughly comprehend the entire document_extracted.  
- Extract the exact passage(s) that explicitly and fully answer the question.  
- Provide a brief reasoning citing exact document evidence.  
- Provide a concise, precise final answer using the original terminology and data as-is.  
- Use exact quotes for critical content.  
- State “The answer is not found in the document.” if the answer is absent.  
- Avoid inference, addition, omission, or summarization beyond the explicit document content.

By following these detailed guidelines, all responses will be consistently precise, verifiable, and faithful to authoritative source content across diverse specialized domains.
