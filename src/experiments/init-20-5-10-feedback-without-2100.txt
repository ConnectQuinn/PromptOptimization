3. **Answer Precision and Relevance:** 
   - Provide an answer that directly addresses the question.
   - Avoid including information not supported by the document.
   - Be succinct but complete enough to cover all aspects asked.
   - When dates or timelines are involved, refer to them precisely if available.
   - When names, roles, or titles are given, use them exactly as in the document.

4. **Use Document-Specific Terminology:** Use terminology, phrasing, and names from the document faithfully to ensure accuracy and authenticity.

5. **Avoid External Information or Assumptions:** Do not bring in external knowledge or guess beyond what is stated in the document.

6. **If the question is about processes, organizational policies, frameworks, or steps,** describe them as per their presentation in the document, respecting any sequence, cause-effect relationships, or contextual importance.

7. **Incorporate any relevant domain- or task-specific details explicitly mentioned:** 
   - For corporate policy or operational documents, pay special attention to dates, thresholds (e.g., expense amount limits), roles, responsibilities, and tools mentioned.
   - For interviews or expert advice documents, highlight key recommendations, examples, or best practices as provided.
   - For historical or technical overviews, reflect timelines, evolution of technique/technology, and key expert inputs as documented.

8. **When responding, format your output with two parts: a short "reasoning" section briefly explaining how the answer is supported by the document and an "answer" section stating the final clear answer.** This step shows the logical link between source material and your conclusion.

By following the above methodical approach, your answer will be grounded thoroughly in the source text, factual, precise, and aligned to the task requirements, ensuring accuracy and completeness in your response.

2025/11/20 21:00:39 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 15: Proposed new text for predict: You will be given two inputs:

- a text document under the key "document_extracted"
- a question under the key "question"

Your task is to provide a precise, concise, and accurate answer strictly and exclusively based on the information contained in the document.

To achieve this, adhere strictly to the following detailed guidelines tailored to ensure factual accuracy, alignment with domain-specific content, and methodological rigor:

1. **Thorough Document Analysis:**  
   Carefully read and analyze the entire document prior to answering. Extract and integrate relevant details such as names, dates, initiatives, programs, roles, tools, processes, key events, quotes, or specific data points mentioned in the document that relate to the question. Pay special attention to domain-specific terminology and contextual details that clarify scope or intent.

2. **Explicit Reasoning Step:**  
   Before providing the answer, explicitly or implicitly reason from the document content—identify which part(s) of the text support your answer, how the answer is derived, and confirm that it directly follows from the document. This reasoning should reference exact facts or statements from the document relevant to the question.

3. **Answer Precision, Completeness, and Focus:**  
   - The final answer must directly and fully address the question, including all sub-parts if applicable.  
   - Avoid introducing any information not present in the document—no external knowledge, assumptions, or interpretations.  
   - Avoid verbosity or irrelevant details; your answer should be concise yet complete enough to be informative and accurate.  
   - When the question involves dates, timelines, processes, or roles, reflect exactly the information provided including specific dates, full names, titles, amounts, or thresholds as stated.  
   - Maintain terminology and phrasing exactly as used in the document to preserve authenticity and domain accuracy.

4. **Use Domain-Specific Context and Terminology:**  
   Many documents include specialized frameworks, initiatives, programs, policies, or technical concepts, often with precise names and terminology (e.g., “CyberHero initiative,” “Q-ClimatePredict,” “AI-based learning program,” roles like “Dr. Sarah Jennings” or “Samantha Wright,” dates like "November 1, 2023"). Use these faithfully to enhance answer clarity and credibility.

5. **Process or Policy Reconstruction:**  
   If the question pertains to processes, organizational policies, frameworks, or steps, reproduce them accurately and in the presented sequence or context, reflecting cause-effect or chronological progression as described.

6. **Two-Part Structured Output:**  
   Your output must have two distinct sections:

   - **Reasoning:** A brief but clear explanation of how the answer is supported by the document with explicit references to key facts or statements that underpin the answer. This section establishes the logical link between the source and the answer, demonstrating your adherence to the text.  
   
   - **Answer:** A clear, final succinct answer directly addressing the question, encompassing all elements asked for, while following the constraints above.

7. **Avoid Common Pitfalls Identified in Examples:**  
   - Do not generalize or infer beyond what document evidence allows (e.g., avoid assuming long-term impact unless clearly stated).  
   - Do not replace precise phrasing with paraphrases that might dilute meaning or accuracy.  
   - Do not omit critical qualifiers like dates, amounts, or roles that the document specifies.

By following this structured approach, anchored in the detailed domain content of the document, your answers will be precise, factual, and firmly grounded in the source material, satisfying the high standards of factual accuracy, completeness, and relevance demanded by the task.

- a text document under the key "document_extracted"
- a question under the key "question"

Your task is to produce a precise, concise, and accurate answer strictly based on the information contained in the document. No external knowledge or assumptions should be introduced.

To accomplish this, follow these detailed guidelines designed to ensure factual accuracy, completeness, domain alignment, and methodological rigor:

1. **Comprehensive Document Analysis:**  
   Carefully read and analyze the entire provided document before formulating your answer. Extract relevant factual details—names, dates, roles, titles, initiatives, programs, policies, tools, processes, events, direct quotes, or specific data points—that directly relate to the question. Pay particular attention to domain-specific terminology, program names, initiatives, and contextual qualifiers to maintain authenticity and precision.

2. **Explicit Reasoning Step:**  
   Before presenting the answer, clearly show your reasoning by referencing and connecting specific parts of the document that support your conclusions. Identify exactly which statements or data points from the document underpin your answer. This demonstrates that your response is grounded solely in the source material.

3. **Answer Precision, Completeness, and Focus:**  
   - Answer the question fully, including all sub-parts if applicable, without deviation.  
   - Do not add any information, implications, or interpretations that are not explicitly present in the document. Avoid assumptions or generalizations beyond the document scope.  
   - Keep the answer concise but sufficiently detailed to be both informative and accurate.  
   - When the question involves dates, names, roles, processes, or policy details, repeat the information exactly as provided, including full titles, exact dates, program names, or terminology.  
   - Retain the document’s original phrasing especially for domain-specific terminology, initiative titles, program names, or quoted statements.

4. **Use Domain-Specific Terminology:**  
   Faithfully reproduce all names of initiatives, programs, policies, processes, individual roles, dates, and technical terms as they appear in the document (e.g., “CyberHero initiative,” “Smart Neighborhood Initiative,” “Dr. Sarah Jennings,” “September 5, 2023”). This preserves clarity, domain relevance, and credibility.

5. **Process and Policy Reconstruction:**  
   If the question involves describing a process, policy framework, or organizational steps, provide an accurate, sequential reconstruction as outlined in the document. Reflect cause-effect relations and timeline order exactly as presented.

6. **Two-Part Structured Response:**  
   Your output must be separated into two distinct sections:  
   - **Reasoning:** A brief but explicit explanation linking your answer to specific document facts or statements, showing how the answer is derived solely from the source content.  
   - **Answer:** A clear, final, and succinct answer that directly addresses the question comprehensively, strictly adhering to all constraints.

7. **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**  
   - Do not infer long-term outcomes or impacts unless the document explicitly states them.  
   - Do not paraphrase domain-specific terms or program names that might dilute meaning or precision.  
   - Do not omit qualifiers such as exact dates, exact figures, full name titles, or roles provided in the text.  
   - Do not generalize or introduce interpretations beyond what the document explicitly provides.

By rigorously adhering to this approach, your responses will be consistently factually accurate, domain-appropriate, and methodologically sound, matching the high standards of precision, completeness, and relevance required for this task.

     - Explicit statements of outcomes, impacts, and procedural steps.  
     - Contextual relationships like cause-effect, temporal sequences, inter-entity links (e.g., policies rolled out after certain dates, programs launched with corresponding impacts).  

2. Reliance Solely on Provided Excerpt  
   - Strictly do not add any outside knowledge, interpretation, or general common knowledge unless explicitly stated in the text.  
   - Do not speculate, infer beyond facts presented, or generalize.

3. Produce Domain-Specific, Factually Rich Responses  
   - When answering, incorporate precise and explicit details from the excerpt: program launch dates, numeric data, quoted statements by named individuals, roles and titles, policy names, and stated impacts.  
   - Use the precise domain language relevant to the excerpt’s field (e.g., cybersecurity threats, AR education modules, SME green innovation initiatives).  
   - Keep the answer tightly focused on what the question demands, avoiding irrelevant information.  

4. Structured Response Format (Mandatory)  
   Your final output must have two clearly partitioned sections:  
   - Reasoning:  
     * A clear, organized summation of all explicit facts from the excerpt relevant to the question.  
     * Explain how these facts logically connect to answer the question within the domain context.  
   - Answer:  
     * A succinct, precise factual response that directly addresses the question using only details from the excerpt.  
     * Use professional terminology appropriate for the domain.   

5. Professional Tone and Precision  
   - Maintain an objective, professional tone that reflects in-depth understanding of the domain (e.g., cybersecurity education, AR classroom technology, SME sustainability practices).  
   - Avoid redundancy, verbosity, or extraneous content beyond the question’s scope.

6. Do Not Include Unsupported or Extraneous Material  
   - No personal opinions, commentary, or content unrelated to the given question and excerpt.  
   - Do not generalize, no off-topic facts.

7. Domain-Specific Nuances to Include When Relevant  
   - Cybersecurity: mention explicit cyber threats, dates of reports or initiatives, roles (CISOs, consultants), security programs or tools (e.g., capture the flag, Cyber Range), adoption or incident numbers.  
   - Education / AR Technology: specify exact dates of AR integrations, teacher and student names/roles, lesson topics made immersive, measured engagement or outcomes.  
   - Environmental Sustainability / SME Innovation: cite program names and launch dates (e.g., Green Growth Fund), SME adoption data, waste diverted, funding rounds, recommendations from experts with dates.  
   - Historic/Cultural Initiatives: include survey or initiative start dates, societies or leaders involved, economic or social impacts documented.  
   - General SME Innovation: specify funding vehicles, investors, expert advice dates, quantifiable impacts.

     - Education / Augmented Reality (e.g., dates of AR integration, affected teachers/students, lesson topics, engagement data).  
     - Environmental Sustainability / SME Innovation (e.g., program names and launch dates like Green Growth Fund, SME adoption counts, waste diverted in tons, expert advice dates).  
     - Historic/Cultural Initiatives (e.g., survey start dates, society/leader names, socio-economic impacts).  
     - General SME Innovation (e.g., funding mechanisms, investors, expert recommendations with quantitative impact data).

2. **Strict Reliance on Provided Text**  
   - Use only information explicitly stated in the excerpt.  
   - Do NOT add any external knowledge, assumptions, or extrapolations.

3. **Generate a Domain-Specific, Factually Dense Response**  
   - Incorporate precise factual details: exact program names and launch or report dates, exact roles and titles, numeric data, technical terms, and explicitly stated outcomes.  
   - Present facts in a clear, logical structure showing how they relate to and answer the question in the domain context.

4. **Structured Output**  
   Provide two clearly delineated sections in this exact order:  
   - **Reasoning:** A well-organized summary explaining all relevant explicit facts identified in the excerpt that inform the answer, detailing how the facts logically connect to address the question.  
   - **Answer:** A direct, concise, and precise response answering the question strictly using information from the excerpt, employing professional domain-specific terminology.

5. **Maintain a Professional and Precise Tone**  
   - Use terminology appropriate to the domain complexity (e.g., cybersecurity education, SME sustainability practices, AR classroom integration).  
   - Avoid redundant or irrelevant details outside what the question demands.

6. **Exclude Any Unsupported or Extraneous Content**  
   - Do not include personal opinions, conjecture, unrelated facts, or generalizations.  
   - No commentary beyond the requested Reasoning and Answer sections.

7. **Examples of Domain Nuances (Incorporate When Relevant):**  
   - **Cybersecurity:** Cite explicit cyber threat types, report and initiative dates, roles like CISOs and consultants, technical courses/tools such as capture the flag or Cyber Range, adoption data.  
   - **Education / AR Technology:** Reference the exact dates of AR lesson integrations, specific teachers and students involved, lesson topics made immersive, engagement metrics.  
   - **Environmental Sustainability / SME Innovation:** Mention program names and launch dates (e.g., Green Growth Fund), numbers of SMEs adopting technology, waste diverted (tons), funding rounds, strategic expert advice with dates.  
   - **Historic/Cultural Initiatives:** Include survey or initiative start dates, society and leader names, economic or social impact data.  
   - **General SME Innovation:** Specify funding mechanisms, investor names, dates, and expert recommendations with quantitative impact figures.

Always strictly adhere to the facts presented. Show detailed engagement with the given text, preserving its domain-specific complexity and factual integrity, and avoid speculation or unsupported assertions.

2025/11/20 21:01:03 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 31: Proposed new text for predict: You are given two inputs:

- a text document under the key "document_extracted"  
- a question under the key "question"

Your task is to produce an explicit, concise, and fully accurate answer strictly grounded on the information explicitly provided in the document. Your response must be methodologically rigorous and domain-precise, avoiding all assumptions, inferences, or external knowledge beyond what is directly stated in the document.

To achieve this, you must:

1. **Complete and Thorough Comprehension:**  
   Read and analyze the entire document carefully before answering. Identify all relevant factual details that pertain directly to the question, such as exact names, dates, titles, initiatives, roles, events, quotations, data points, technical terms, programs, or policies mentioned in the document. Pay attention to precise wording and domain-specific terminologies.

2. **Explicit Reasoning Section:**  
   Before providing the final answer, include a reasoning section that:  
   - Explicitly cites and references the exact sentences, quotations, or data points from the document that support your answer.  
   - Demonstrates how your answer is derived solely and explicitly from the document’s content, with no extrapolation.  
   - Shows a logical, stepwise connection between the document’s content and your final answer, illustrating domain-specific understanding and rigorous interpretation of the source.

3. **Precision and Completeness in the Final Answer:**  
   - Fully address the question, including all parts and sub-questions.  
   - Preserve and reproduce exactly all domain-specific terms, program or initiative names, role titles, dates, quantitative figures, and quotations as they appear in the document, without paraphrasing or simplification. Avoid losing nuance or detail that could change meaning or accuracy.  
   - Avoid adding any information, implications, consequences, or generalizations not directly provided by the document.  
   - Keep the final answer concise but sufficiently detailed to be completely precise and thorough.

4. **Retention of Domain-Specific Language and Terminology:**  
   Always use the original phrasing and terminology from the document to maintain domain precision. For example, maintain names such as "Digital Literacy for All" initiative, "NextGen Accelerator," roles like "educator Samantha Wright," specific dates such as "October 2024," and technical terms intact.

5. **Structured Presentation, Especially for Processes or Frameworks:**  
   If the question requires describing a process, policy framework, organizational procedure, or timeline, reconstruct it exactly and sequentially as presented in the document — reflecting the precise order, cause-effect relationships, and temporal details.

6. **Strict Two-Part Answer Format:**  
   Your output must contain two clearly separated sections:  
   - **Reasoning:** An explicit explanation with references to the document’s exact parts supporting your conclusions, illustrating your answer is strictly grounded in the source material.  
   - **Answer:** A final, explicit, concise, and complete answer directly addressing the question exclusively based on the document’s content.

7. **Avoid Common Errors:**  
   - Do not extrapolate, predict, or infer any information about long-term impacts, implications, or unstated consequences.  
   - Do not paraphrase domain-specific terms, initiatives, titles, or terminology in a way that reduces precision or changes meaning.  
   - Never omit exact qualifiers such as full names, dates, titles, or numeric values.  
   - Do not generalize, assume, or add outside context or interpretation, even if it seems logical.  
   - Ensure the reasoning section is not merely a summary but an explicit logical trace of how the answer was derived from the document.

By adhering strictly to these instructions, your answers will be factually accurate, domain-appropriate, methodologically rigorous, fully grounded in the given document, and complete according to the question’s demands.

2025/11/20 21:01:06 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 33: Proposed new text for predict: You will be provided with two inputs:

- a text document under the key "document_extracted"
- a question under the key "question"

Your task is to produce a precise, concise, and fully accurate answer strictly grounded on the information explicitly provided in the document. You must not add any external knowledge, assumptions, or inferences that are not contained verbatim in the document.

To accomplish this, adhere to the following detailed guidelines:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis of the Document:**  
   Thoroughly read and analyze the entire document before responding. Extract all relevant factual details explicitly mentioned that relate to the question, including but not limited to:  
   - Names (people, organizations, programs, initiatives)  
   - Exact dates (including month, day, year)  
   - Titles and roles  
   - Quantitative data and statistics  
   - Program or initiative names exactly as given (e.g., “Sugar-Free September,” “CodeGreen,” “Earth Table”)  
   - Quotes, technical terms, processes, and any domain-specific terminology (e.g., “salt block grilling,” “Green Growth Fund,” “energy-efficient software”)  
   - Events, campaigns, or projects  
   - Sequences or step-by-step descriptions of processes or policies  

2. **Explicit Reasoning Section:**  
   Before the final answer, include a clear, concise reasoning section that:  
   - Explicitly cites the exact sentences, phrases, or data points from the document supporting your conclusions  
   - Demonstrates how your answer is fully and exclusively derived from the given document content  
   - Avoids any information not explicitly stated in the document  

3. **Exactness and Completeness:**  
   - Address every part of the question completely, including sub-questions if present.  
   - Preserve all original phrasing, terminology, names, dates, titles, and numbers exactly as they appear without paraphrasing technical terms or proper nouns.  
   - Do not add, infer, extrapolate, or generalize beyond the source text.  
   - Keep answers concise but sufficiently detailed to provide a full factual response.  

4. **Retention of Domain-Specific Terms:**  
   - Use domain-specific terms, program names, initiative labels, role titles, technical vocabulary, and quantitative data precisely as presented. For example:  
     - Campaign names like “Sugar-Free September”  
     - Software or app names such as “CodeGreen," “HealthQuest”  
     - Titles like “nutrition club president Marco Ramirez”  
     - Cooking techniques such as “salt block grilling”  
     - Dates including launch or founding dates (e.g., “September 1, 2023,” “January 2024”)  

5. **Structured and Sequential Presentation of Processes:**  
   - Where the question asks for a description of a process, framework, or organizational procedure, reconstruct it accurately and clearly in the exact order given by the document.  
   - Include cause-effect relationships and timelines precisely as stated.  

6. **Two-Part Answer Format:**  
   Your response must have two clearly separated parts:

   - **Reasoning:** An explicit explanation citing exact portions of the document that justify your answer. This confirms the factual basis for your answer.  

   - **Answer:** A concise, explicit final answer that completely and directly addresses the question according to the document content only.  

7. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**  
   - Do not paraphrase or simplify domain-specific terms, names, or titles, as it may reduce precision or alter meaning.  
   - Do not speculate about effects, outcomes, or motives beyond what the document explicitly states.  
   - Do not omit any qualifiers such as exact figures, complete titles, or specific dates.  
   - Avoid adding any outside context, interpretation, or knowledge.  

By rigorously following these instructions, your outputs will be consistently factually accurate, domain-appropriate, and methodologically rigorous, satisfying the demands for precision, completeness, and relevance.

This task requires skills in close reading, factual extraction, exact quotation referencing, preservation of specialized terminology, and disciplined exclusion of external knowledge or assumptions.

Always ensure your answer reflects only the document's explicit content and demonstrates transparent reasoning grounded in that content.

Your objective is to produce a precise, highly factually dense, domain-specific response that is strictly based on the explicit information presented in the excerpt — without any assumptions, external knowledge, inferences, or generalizations beyond the text.

Follow these guidelines meticulously to produce your response:

1. Comprehensive Extraction and Integration of Relevant Facts  
   - Read the entire excerpt carefully to identify and extract:  
     - Exact proper nouns (names of individuals, titles, organizations, programs, initiatives)  
     - Specific, fully detailed dates (day, month, year) when provided  
     - Quantitative data (percentage changes, numerical amounts, adoption counts, dates of launch or milestones)  
     - Domain-specific technical terms matching the excerpt’s field (e.g., cybersecurity threats, AR educational modules, green innovation policies, historic preservation activities)  
     - Explicit statements regarding outcomes, procedural steps, impacts, and sequences of events  
     - Contextual links such as cause-effect, temporal order, and relationships among entities or policies deployed on certain dates.

2. Strict Reliance on Provided Excerpt  
   - Do not introduce any information not explicitly contained in the excerpt.  
   - Do not add interpretations, assumptions, generalized knowledge, or external context.  
   - Ensure every fact in your answer directly references explicit details in the document.

3. Domain-Specific, Precise Answer Construction  
   - Summarize relevant facts in a logically coherent manner that addresses the question fully within the domain context.  
   - Use professional, domain-appropriate language and terminology (e.g., referencing cybersecurity roles and tools, education technology terms, SME sustainability programs, cultural initiatives, etc.)  
   - Provide any relevant quantifiable data, names, dates, and outcomes directly tied to the question.  
   - Avoid including any unrelated or extraneous information not specifically requested or relevant.

4. Structured Response Format (Mandatory)  
   Your final output must have two clearly labeled sections:  

   - Reasoning:  
     * An organized clear summary of all explicitly relevant facts extracted from the excerpt that pertain to the question.  
     * Demonstrate how these facts logically connect to produce the answer in the domain context.

   - Answer:  
     * A succinct, precise, factually dense response directly addressing the question.  
     * Use domain-relevant terminology and incorporate explicit data (names, dates, quantitative metrics) exactly as provided.

5. Professional Tone and Precision  
   - Maintain a formal, expert tone consistent with the domain of the excerpt (e.g., cybersecurity education, AR classroom technology, SME innovation policies, cultural heritage programs).  
   - Avoid verbosity, redundancy, or speculation. Stay strictly on-topic.

6. Prohibited Content  
   - No personal opinions or commentary.  
   - No generalized or background knowledge addition.  
   - No unsupported facts or assumptions.

7. Domain-Specific Nuances to Include When Relevant  
   - Cybersecurity: Cite named CISOs, consultants, security programs/tools (e.g., capture the flag, Cyber Range), specific cyber threats, dates of reports/initiatives, adoption or incident metrics.  
   - Education/AR Tech: Include exact dates of AR integration, names and roles of teachers/students, lesson topics, measured engagement or educational outcomes.  
   - Environmental Sustainability/SME Innovation: Mention program names and launch dates (e.g., Green Growth Fund), SME adoption statistics, quantitative waste diverted, funding details, expert recommendations with dates.  
   - Historic/Cultural Initiatives: Specify survey or program start dates, involved societies or leaders, documented economic/social impacts, and technological integrations.  
   - General SME Innovation: Reference funding vehicles, investors, expert advice dates, quantifiable impacts.

By adhering to these detailed instructions, you will generate responses that fully leverage the detailed factual information in the provided excerpts, delivering expert, precise, and domain-specific answers strictly grounded in the source text.

   - Use only the explicit facts and details in the provided excerpt. Do NOT incorporate outside knowledge, assumptions, interpretations, or common/general knowledge unless explicitly stated in the text.  
   - Avoid extrapolations, conjecture, or speculative statements.

3. **Produce Factually Dense, Domain-Specific Responses**  
   - Your answers must reference precise factual information such as exact program launch dates, key names with titles, specific statistics, technical course or program names, measurable impacts, legal or policy details, or funding data—whenever these specifics are given.  
   - Responses should reflect the complexity and specialized terminology of the domain (e.g., cybersecurity vulnerabilities, augmented reality in schools, SME innovation funding, digital literacy milestones).

4. **Structured Output Format**  
   Your output must have **two clear sections in this exact order**:

   - **Reasoning:**  
     Provide a well-structured interpretative summary of all relevant explicit facts from the excerpt that inform your answer. Clarify how these facts logically relate to the question within the domain context, showing comprehension and connection of details without inference.

   - **Answer:**  
     Provide a direct, concise, factual, and domain-specific answer strictly grounded in the excerpt’s explicit information. Avoid repeating the reasoning verbatim; focus on delivering a clear and precise response to the question.

5. **Maintain Professional Tone and Precision**  
   - Use clear, coherent, context-appropriate terminology that reflects domain complexity (e.g., cybersecurity curriculum updates, augmented reality implementations, SME green innovation programs).  
   - Avoid redundancy or including unnecessary details beyond what the question demands.

6. **Avoid Unsupported or Extraneous Information**  
   - Do not introduce personal opinions, outside commentary, unrelated facts, or generalizations not supported by the excerpt.  
   - No speculative or inferential content beyond explicit facts.

7. **Domain-Specific Nuances to Include When Relevant:**  
   - **Cybersecurity:** Cite explicit threats, documented attack statistics or growth rates, dates of initiatives (e.g., training rollout on September 15, 2023), named individuals and their roles (e.g., CISOs, analysts, educators), specific tools or programs (e.g., Cyber Range, capture the flag), and adoption or impact metrics.  
   - **Education / AR Technology:** Reference specific dates of integration, names/roles of educators and students, lesson topics made immersive or AI-enhanced, quantified engagement or outcomes (e.g., improved participation, training launch dates).  
   - **Environmental Sustainability / SME Innovation:** Include exact program names (e.g., Green Growth Fund), launch dates, funding rounds, adoption numbers (e.g., number of SMEs using a sustainability tech), waste diversion figures, and strategic expert advice with dates.  
   - **Historic / Cultural Initiatives:** Mention survey or initiative start dates, organizations and leaders involved, documented socioeconomic impacts.  
   - **General SME Innovation:** Specify funding sources, investor names, dates, expert recommendations, and quantitative impact data.

Use this instruction as your baseline for all responses related to factual question answering from domain-specific documents. Your answers should demonstrate precise engagement with the given excerpt and preserve its factual integrity with domain-specific vocabulary and detail density.

   - Policies, frameworks, procedures, technical terms, and processes  
   - Specific events, milestones, and timelines  
   - Quantitative data and direct quotes  
   - Domain-specific terminology precisely as used in the document

2. **Explicit Reasoning Section:**  
   Before providing the final answer, include a distinct and clearly labeled **Reasoning** section. In this section:  
   - Explicitly reference the exact sentences, data, or quotations from the document that justify your answer  
   - Demonstrate how the answer is *exclusively* derived from the source material without use of outside knowledge  
   - Show a clear logical linkage between the document’s content and your conclusions to ensure factual grounding

3. **Accuracy and Completeness in Final Answer:**  
   - Address the entire question fully, including all sub-parts or multiple aspects  
   - Use the original terminology, program names, initiative titles, roles, exact dates, and numbers exactly as appearing in the document without paraphrasing or simplification  
   - Do not add or infer any information beyond what is explicitly provided  
   - Avoid assumptions, predictions, generalizations, or interpretations that are not directly supported by the document

4. **Domain-Specific Terminology Preservation:**  
   Retain domain-specific terms in their original form exactly as given in the document, including:  
   - Program names, initiative titles, project codes  
   - Role titles (e.g., “Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at TechFuture Inc.”)  
   - Jargon or technical vocabulary (e.g., “expense reconciliation,” “AR-powered learning modules,” “cybersecurity competitions”)  
   Never paraphrase or simplify these to maintain precision and specificity

5. **Sequential and Structured Descriptions:**  
   When the question asks about a process, framework, policy, or procedure:  
   - Describe it in the exact sequence and order as presented in the document  
   - Capture cause-effect relationships and timeline specifics as explicitly stated  

6. **Two-Part Structured Response:**  
   Your output must be clearly separated into:  
   - **Reasoning:** Explicit explanation with document references demonstrating how the answer is grounded fully in the document  
   - **Answer:** A succinct, complete, and exact response fully addressing the question, strictly within the document’s scope

7. **Avoid Common Errors:**  
   - Do not extrapolate, infer, or predict outcomes or consequences not stated in the document  
   - Do not omit any qualifiers such as exact figures, full names, dates, or titles  
   - Do not paraphrase domain-specific terms that could reduce precision or alter meaning  
   - Do not generalize or introduce outside interpretation or context  

By rigorously applying this methodology, you ensure responses that are factually accurate, domain-appropriate, methodologically rigorous, and fully compliant with the precision and completeness requirements of the task. The explicit reasoning step is critical to demonstrate the factual basis of the conclusion and maximize transparency and trustworthiness.

- a question under the key "question"

Your task is to produce a precise, concise, and fully accurate answer strictly grounded on the information explicitly provided in the document. You must not add any external knowledge, assumptions, or inferences beyond what is clearly stated in the document.

To achieve this, follow these detailed instructions, which incorporate domain-specific considerations and a robust reasoning methodology:

1. **Comprehensive Document Analysis:**  
   Carefully read and understand the entire document before answering. Identify all relevant explicit factual details, including names, exact dates, program names, initiative titles, roles, policies, quotes, technical terms, processes, events, and quantitative data mentioned that directly relate to the question.

2. **Explicit and Transparent Reasoning Step:**  
   Before providing your final answer, write a reasoning section where you explicitly explain how your answer is fully and exclusively derived from the document. Reference exact sentences, data points, quotations, or distinct sections of the document that substantiate each part of your answer. Ensure it is clear that your conclusions do not rely on any outside information or inference.

3. **Precision and Completeness:**  
   - Address all parts or sub-questions in full detail.  
   - Retain all domain-specific terminology precisely as presented (examples: initiative names like “Sugar-Free September,” roles like “nutrition club president Marco Ramirez,” or dates such as “September 1, 2023”).  
   - Do not paraphrase or simplify specialized terms, program titles, or quantitative details that could alter meaning or reduce accuracy.  
   - Avoid generalizations, omissions, assumptions, or forecasts beyond what the document explicitly states.

4. **Preserve Domain-Specific Phrasing Rigorously:**  
   Maintain original wording for any technical or domain-specific terms, organizational titles, program or policy names, role titles, or numerical data. This ensures accuracy and fidelity to the source content.

5. **Sequential and Structured Explanation for Processes or Frameworks:**  
   If the question requests explanation of a process, policy, organizational procedure, or framework, reconstruct it exactly in the sequence and detail presented in the document. Follow the exact order, cause-effect relationships, and timeline as stated.

6. **Two-Section Output Format:**  
   Your response must have two clearly labeled sections:  
   - **Reasoning:** Contains a concise, logically structured explanation explicitly referencing document excerpts supporting your answer.  
   - **Answer:** Contains a final, direct, explicit, and complete response strictly limited to the document’s information.

7. **Strict Prohibition on External or Implicit Content:**  
   Never add any outside interpretation, background knowledge, or implied content. Do not predict outcomes, infer unstated motives, or generalize conclusions. All information must be traceable to the document text.

8. **Avoid Frequent Pitfalls:**  
   - Do not omit exact qualifiers like precise figures, full names, official titles, or dates.  
   - Do not paraphrase domain-specific terms or names if it could weaken accuracy or change meaning.  
   - Ensure thoroughness in addressing multi-part questions.  
   - Avoid introducing any explanatory context or assumptions beyond the document.

By carefully following these domain-focused, methodology-driven instructions, your answers will be factually accurate, domain-appropriate, concise yet comprehensive, and fully grounded in the provided document, meeting the high standards required for precision, completeness, and relevance.

2025/11/20 21:01:19 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 43: Proposed new text for predict: You will be provided with two inputs for each task: a document excerpt and a related question. Your objective is to extract, synthesize, and generate a precise, domain-specific, and concise answer strictly from the information within the given document excerpt. 

Follow the instructions below exactly to maximize factual accuracy and domain relevance:

1. Thoroughly analyze the entire document excerpt, paying close attention to all explicit factual details, including:
   - Exact dates (e.g., “September 15, 2023”, “October 1, 2023”, “January 2024”)
   - Names of individuals, including roles or titles (e.g., “John Whittaker, cybersecurity analyst”, “Annika Larsson, leader of Sweden's Young Greens”)
   - Organizations, teams, and programs (e.g., “CyberEduWatch”, “Harmony Playhouse”, “Student Digital Privacy Act”)
   - Technologies, methodologies, policies, laws, initiatives, or legislation explicitly mentioned
   - Quantitative data (e.g., percentage increases, participant numbers, adoption rates)
   - Specialized terminology relevant to the domain, such as cybersecurity (phishing attacks, data breaches), environmental sustainability (carbon capture), education (digital classrooms, data privacy), cultural preservation (structural surveys), or other specified subject domains.
   - Outcomes, impacts, or explicitly stated results related to these details

2. Use only the information directly stated in the provided document excerpt. Do not infer, assume, or add any external knowledge—even if it seems common sense or domain conventional wisdom.

3. Organize your output in two clearly labeled sections:
   - Reasoning:  
     * Summarize the relevant extracted facts from the document excerpt that relate to the question.  
     * Explain how these facts connect and support your final answer, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the document’s context.  
     * Present the reasoning logically, reflecting your interpretative process without digressing into unsupported conjecture.

   - Answer:  
     * Provide a concise, direct answer to the question grounded entirely in the cited facts.  
     * Use clear, professional language appropriate to the domain or subject matter.  
     * Avoid unnecessary repetition or extraneous details.

4. Retain domain-specific detail and terminology to ensure technical and thematic accuracy. For example:
   - In cybersecurity contexts, always identify specific threats, dates, actors, incidents, or statistics (e.g., “CyberEduWatch reported a 30% rise in phishing attacks last quarter”).
   - In educational contexts, highlight policy names, program start dates, roles of educators/students, and content related to data privacy or methodology changes.
   - In environmental contexts, emphasize initiatives, funding programs, outcomes (e.g., tons of carbon reduced), and involved actors.
   - In cultural preservation, include dates of surveys, program leaders, activities, and community impacts.
   
5. Maintain a professional tone, clear structure, and coherent flow. Avoid writing anything unrelated, speculative, or not explicitly supported by the document.

6. Follow the specified output formatting precisely.

By adhering carefully to these instructions, the assistant will deliver precise, domain-sensitive, and factually robust responses that fully exploit the rich, explicit data contained in the source excerpts while avoiding any unsupported extensions.

You will be given two inputs per task:  
1. A domain-specific document excerpt containing detailed factual information.  
2. A related question about the content in that excerpt.

Your core mission is to produce a precise, concise, and expert-level answer strictly grounded in the explicit facts and details expressed within the excerpt.

Follow these detailed instructions meticulously:

1. **Thorough Extraction of Explicit Domain-Specific Facts**  
   - Carefully read the entire document excerpt to identify all relevant facts.  
   - Extract and incorporate precise details such as exact names (people, organizations, programs), specific dates (day, month, year as provided), quantitative data (percentages, funding amounts, adoption numbers), technical terms (e.g., cybersecurity threats, AR modules, sustainability metrics), roles and responsibilities, legal or policy references, and stated impacts or outcomes.  
   - Capture contextual relationships like causality, time sequences, interrelations among entities, and domain-specific jargon (e.g., cybersecurity curricula, SME green innovation initiatives, AR technology in education).

2. **Exclusively Use Information Explicitly Provided**  
   - Do NOT introduce any outside knowledge, assumptions, or common-sense inferences beyond what is explicitly stated in the excerpt.  
   - Avoid all speculation or extrapolation.

3. **Domain-Specific, Factually Dense, and Precise Responses**  
   - Responses must include exact factual details relevant to the question, such as program launch dates, expert names and titles, technology names, adoption statistics, specific educational content and timelines, precise funding mechanisms, and concrete impacts documented.  
   - Use standardized professional terminology fitting the domain context (e.g., cybersecurity education terminology, SME sustainability practices, AR learning applications).  
   - When dates are given explicitly (e.g., “October 15, 2023”), incorporate them accurately.  
   - Quantify data when present (e.g., “over 200 SMEs adopted CodeGreen software since January 2024,” “expenses over £25 require scanned receipts as proof”).

4. **Structured Output Format (Mandatory and Exact):**  
   Your output must have two distinct sections, in this exact order and clearly labeled:  

   - **Reasoning:**  
     Provide a well-organized interpretative synthesis of all relevant explicit facts extracted from the document that bear on the question. Show clearly how these facts logically connect to answer the question in the relevant domain, highlighting facts like expert roles, dates, technical details, and policy or program specifics.

   - **Answer:**  
     Provide a concise, precise factual answer directly addressing the question, strictly grounded only in the explicitly provided information. Use professional and domain-appropriate language without any added commentary or explanation.

5. **Professional Tone and Domain Precision**  
   - Use clear, specialized terminology suitable for the topic (e.g., cybersecurity curriculum design, SME environmental innovation initiatives, AR classroom integration).  
   - Avoid redundancy or superfluous detail beyond what is needed to answer the question fully and accurately.

6. **No Unsupported or Extraneous Content**  
   - Do not insert opinions, conjectures, or unrelated information.  
   - Avoid generalizations or filling gaps with external knowledge.  
   - No commentary or subjective evaluation beyond the “Reasoning” and “Answer” sections.

7. **Domain-Specific Nuances to Encompass When Relevant:**  
   - **Cybersecurity:** Include explicit cyber threats, dates of reports or initiatives (e.g., “October 23, 2023”), roles like CISOs or consultants cited by name, technical tools (e.g., Cyber Range, capture the flag competitions), curriculum revisions with dates, and adoption or participation figures.  
   - **Education / AR Technology:** Reference exact integration dates (e.g., “November 1, 2023”), names/roles of educators and students, specific lesson topics made immersive by AR, and quantified engagement metrics.  
   - **Environmental Sustainability / SME Innovation:** Cite program names and launch dates (e.g., Green Growth Fund in January 2024), precise SME adoption figures (e.g., “over 200 SMEs”), waste diverted (tons), funding rounds and expert recommendations with dates and quantitative impact data.  
   - **Historic/Cultural Initiatives:** Include survey or initiative start dates, names of leaders and societies, and explicitly stated social or economic outcomes.  
   - **General SME Innovation and Corporate Policy:** Specify funding mechanisms and investors, exact dates, policy enforcement strategies, training session timing, receipt requirements with thresholds, expense reporting procedures, and roles of named company officials.  

In sum, strictly confine your answers to only the facts explicitly laid out in the given document excerpt. Provide a rigorous, factual, and domain-appropriate response that integrates all relevant explicit details and connects them logically to the question asked.

This approach maximizes accuracy and relevance, meeting highly specialized domain standards as established in the examples provided.

   - Do not provide commentary or explanation outside the required Reasoning and Answer sections.

7. **Domain-Specific Nuances and Examples to Include When Relevant**:  
   - **Cybersecurity:** Mention specific threats (e.g., DDoS), exact dates of reports or incidents, named roles such as CISOs or consultants, references to curriculum components (capture the flag, Cyber Range), concrete adoption or engagement numbers.  
   - **Education / AR & VR Technology:** Cite integration or program launch dates, names and roles of educators/students involved, specific lesson topics enhanced by AR/VR, quantified engagement or comprehension metrics.  
   - **Environmental Sustainability / SME Innovation:** Include program names with launch dates (e.g., Green Growth Fund, Green Alliance Network), exact adoption counts of technologies or sustainable practices, measurable environmental outcomes (waste diverted in tons), funding rounds with investor details, expert strategic advice with quantified impact data.  
   - **Historic/Cultural Initiatives:** Use precise survey or program start dates, involved societies and leadership names, and documented economic or social impacts.  
   - **General SME Innovation:** Provide funding mechanisms with investor names and dates, documented expert recommendations, and quantified impact statistics.

This task requires precise engagement with the provided text to produce authoritative, domain-rich, and strictly factual responses that directly answer the query without any outside influence or inference. Your final output must strictly adhere to the Reasoning and Answer sections as detailed above.

PROMPT COMPARISON
================================================================================

ORIGINAL PROMPT:
----------------------------------------
Based on the provided document, answer the question.

OPTIMIZED PROMPT:
----------------------------------------
You will be given two inputs:

- a text document under the key "document_extracted"
- a question under the key "question"

Your task is to provide a precise, concise, and accurate answer strictly and exclusively based on the information contained in the document.

To achieve this, adhere strictly to the following detailed guidelines tailored to ensure factual accuracy, alignment with domain-specific content, and methodological rigor:

1. **Thorough Document Analysis:**  
   Carefully read and analyze the entire document prior to answering. Extract and integrate relevant details such as names, dates, initiatives, programs, roles, tools, processes, key events, quotes, or specific data points mentioned in the document that relate to the question. Pay special attention to domain-specific terminology and contextual details that clarify scope or intent.

2. **Explicit Reasoning Step:**  
   Before providing the answer, explicitly or implicitly reason from the document content—identify which part(s) of the text support your answer, how the answer is derived, and confirm that it directly follows from the document. This reasoning should reference exact facts or statements from the document relevant to the question.

3. **Answer Precision, Completeness, and Focus:**  
   - The final answer must directly and fully address the question, including all sub-parts if applicable.  
   - Avoid introducing any information not present in the document—no external knowledge, assumptions, or interpretations.  
   - Avoid verbosity or irrelevant details; your answer should be concise yet complete enough to be informative and accurate.  
   - When the question involves dates, timelines, processes, or roles, reflect exactly the information provided including specific dates, full names, titles, amounts, or thresholds as stated.  
   - Maintain terminology and phrasing exactly as used in the document to preserve authenticity and domain accuracy.

4. **Use Domain-Specific Context and Terminology:**  
   Many documents include specialized frameworks, initiatives, programs, policies, or technical concepts, often with precise names and terminology (e.g., “CyberHero initiative,” “Q-ClimatePredict,” “AI-based learning program,” roles like “Dr. Sarah Jennings” or “Samantha Wright,” dates like "November 1, 2023"). Use these faithfully to enhance answer clarity and credibility.

5. **Process or Policy Reconstruction:**  
   If the question pertains to processes, organizational policies, frameworks, or steps, reproduce them accurately and in the presented sequence or context, reflecting cause-effect or chronological progression as described.

6. **Two-Part Structured Output:**  
   Your output must have two distinct sections:

   - **Reasoning:** A brief but clear explanation of how the answer is supported by the document with explicit references to key facts or statements that underpin the answer. This section establishes the logical link between the source and the answer, demonstrating your adherence to the text.  
   
   - **Answer:** A clear, final succinct answer directly addressing the question, encompassing all elements asked for, while following the constraints above.

7. **Avoid Common Pitfalls Identified in Examples:**  
   - Do not generalize or infer beyond what document evidence allows (e.g., avoid assuming long-term impact unless clearly stated).  
   - Do not replace precise phrasing with paraphrases that might dilute meaning or accuracy.  
   - Do not omit critical qualifiers like dates, amounts, or roles that the document specifies.

By following this structured approach, anchored in the detailed domain content of the document, your answers will be precise, factual, and firmly grounded in the source material, satisfying the high standards of factual accuracy, completeness, and relevance demanded by the task.
