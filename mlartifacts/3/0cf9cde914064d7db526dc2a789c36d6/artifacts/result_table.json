However, as our dependence grows, so does the impact of internet service disruptions. These interruptions can be frustrating at best and catastrophic at worst. Since September 1, 2023, industry experts like Amanda Liu of GlobalNet Solutions and James Donovan from the Institute for Technology Assessment, have cited a variety of factors that have contributed to the cessation of online activities. \n\nThe Fragility of the Internet Infrastructure \n\nOne primary cause of internet outages is the physical damage to the infrastructure that supports digital connectivity. On September 15, 2023, a construction mishap in Atlanta, Georgia, led to severed underground fiber-optic cables, resulting in widespread internet outages across the region. Because the internet is a global network of cables, satellites, and servers, any damage to this infrastructure can lead to significant service disruption. Physical destruction can come from construction accidents, like the one in Atlanta, or from natural erosion of the materials over time. \n\nNatural Disasters: A Global Perspective \n\nNatural disasters are another major culprit of interrupted internet services. Hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires can demolish critical infrastructure, making it impossible to maintain an internet connection. In the aftermath of Hurricane Valentina, which struck the eastern coastline on October 4, 2023, millions were left without internet for weeks. This particular hurricane tore down power lines and disrupted satellite signals that played an essential part in maintaining the internet.  \n\nSimilarly, an earthquake in Southeast Asia on November 11, 2023, resulted in severe damage to undersea cables connecting several countries to the global network. Dr. Haruto Tanaka, a leading seismologist in Japan, pointed out that these cables are incredibly vulnerable during seismic events, leading to outages that can take considerable time and resources to repair. \n\nCyber Attacks and Their Increasing Impact \n\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and sophistication, posing a significant risk to internet stability. On September 22, 2023, a well-coordinated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the servers of a major DNS provider temporarily knocked out internet services for tens of thousands of users across the United States. Johnathan Wilkes, a\ncybersecurity analyst, highlighted that such attacks overload the servers with a flood of artificial traffic, causing system crashes and denying legitimate user access. \n\nIssues with Service Providers \n\nThe role of service providers cannot be understated when discussing the causes of internet service disruptions. Often, technical failures within an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) network can lead to outages. On November 2, 2023, a configuration error during routine maintenance by TechNet Communications resulted in a nationwide outage that lasted several hours. The complexity of network management means that even small errors can have wide-reaching effects on connectivity. \n\nWildlife Interference \n\nWhat might often be overlooked in analyses of internet service disruptions is the impact of wildlife on connectivity. Birds building nests on cell towers, rodents chewing through cables, or insects infesting equipment have all been known to cause unexpected outages. Consider the incident on December 1, 2023, in Denver, Colorado, when a beaver chewed through a fiber optic cable along the Platte River, bringing down internet service for an entire neighborhood. Environmental biologist Sarah Goldberg emphasizes that, as urban areas expand into wildlife habitats, such occurrences are likely to increase. \n\nSpace Weather Phenomena \n\nSpace weather, including solar flares and geomagnetic storms, can also impact internet connectivity. These cosmic events can cause satellite malfunctions and GPS disruptions, leading to a domino effect on connected services. Astrophysicist Dr. Michael Richter, in his research published on December 10, 2023, explains that the charged particles from solar flares can induce currents in long cables, potentially damaging the network infrastructure. \n\nThe Aging Infrastructure Challenge \n\nAs noted by tech analyst Ricardo Gomez on January 5, 2024, the aging internet infrastructure is another significant factor that leads to more frequent service disruptions. Much of the cabling and hardware was installed decades ago and is not always maintained to keep up with the demand of modern high-speed internet use. As this equipment becomes obsolete or degrades, the network's resilience to any form of stress diminishes. \n\nStrategies for Mitigating the Impact of Natural Disasters \n\nFacing the undeniable fact that natural disasters can precipitate internet service disruptions, it brings us to consider strategies to mitigate their impact on global connectivity. Governments and companies have begun strengthening the internet infrastructure to resist natural calamities. Building more robust and higher-capacity\nnetworks that are less susceptible to breaks, such as submarine cables capable of withstanding seismic activities, are part of the solution. \n\nOn the other hand, diversifying the means of our connectivity also plays a key role. For instance, supporting traditional cable systems with satellite internet can provide a crucial backup during terrestrial outages. Following Hurricane Valentina, emergency communication services were maintained via satellite connections, spotlighting the importance of redundancy in networks. \n\nMoreover, the development of disaster recovery plans is essential. These include efficient rerouting of traffic in case of outages and rapid deployment teams ready to repair damaged infrastructure. TechNet Communications and other ISPs have started conducting regular disaster simulations to prepare for and quickly respond to any service interruption scenarios. \n\nPublic Awareness and Community Resilience \n\nLastly, bolstering community resilience through public awareness and education is imperative. Communities equipped with knowledge and resources to deal with internet outages can minimize the disruption's impact on their daily lives and businesses. Public campaigns and readily available resources on how to stay connected, or manage without connectivity during outages, have proven invaluable during recent events. Community centers equipped with emergency internet connectivity can serve as hubs during widespread disruptions, ensuring that essential services remain uninterrupted. \n\nAs we continue to navigate through the digital landscape, recognizing the myriad causes of internet service disruptions is vital. The collaboration between governments, ISPs, tech companies, and communities is imperative to develop robust strategies to mitigate the impact of these disruptions. While total prevention of outages may not be feasible, with the right planning and technology, the resilience of our internet connectivity can be significantly improved, securing its role as a lifeline in the modern world.\n","According to tech analyst Ricardo Gomez, what aging aspect of internet infrastructure contributes to service disruptions?","The aging internet infrastructure which includes obsolete cabling and hardware.","The document explicitly mentions tech analyst Ricardo Gomez and his commentary on January 5, 2024, regarding the aging internet infrastructure. It refers to the specific aspect of the infrastructure that contributes to service disruptions as being the cabling and hardware installed decades ago, which is not always maintained and becomes obsolete or degraded over time.
